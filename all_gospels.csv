23162,So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations,0
23163,Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this for after his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph before they came together she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit,0
23164,Joseph her husband being a righteous man and not willing to make her a public example intended to put her away secretly,0
23165,But when he thought about these things behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph son of David dont be afraid to take to yourself Mary your wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit,0
23166,She shall bring forth a son You shall call his name Jesus for it is he who shall save his people from their sins,0
23167,Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet saying,0
23168,Behold the virgin shall be with child And shall bring forth a son They shall call his name Immanuel Which is being interpreted God with us,0
23169,Joseph arose from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife to himself,0
23170,and didnt know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son He named him Jesus,0
23171,Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold wise menThe word for wise men magoi can also mean teachers priests physicians astrologers seers interpreters of dreams or sorcerers from the east came to Jerusalem saying,0
23172,Where is he who is born King of the Jews For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him,0
23173,When Herod the king heard it he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him,0
23174,Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he asked them where the Christ would be born,0
23175,They said to him In Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written through the prophet,0
23176,You Bethlehem land of Judah Are in no way least among the princes of Judah For out of you shall come forth a governor Who shall shepherd my people Israel,0
23177,Then Herod secretly called the wise men and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared,0
23178,He sent them to Bethlehem and said Go and search diligently for the young child When you have found him bring me word so that I also may come and worship him,0
23179,They having heard the king went their way and behold the star which they saw in the east went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was,0
23180,When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy,0
23181,They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother and they fell down and worshiped him Opening their treasures they offered to him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh,0
23182,Being warned in a dream that they shouldnt return to Herod they went back to their own country another way,0
23183,Now when they had departed behold an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying Arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and stay there until I tell you for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him,0
23184,He arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt,0
23185,and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet saying Out of Egypt I called my son,0
23186,Then Herod when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men was exceedingly angry and sent out and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside from two years old and under according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men,0
23187,Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled saying,0
23188,A voice was heard in Ramah Lamentation weeping and great mourning Rachel weeping for her children She wouldnt be comforted Because they are no more,0
23189,But when Herod was dead behold an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt saying,0
23190,Arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel for those who sought the young childs life are dead,0
23191,He arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of Israel,0
23192,But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father Herod he was afraid to go there Being warned in a dream he withdrew into the region of Galilee,0
23193,and came and lived in a city called Nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets He will be called a Nazarene,0
23194,In those days John the Baptizer came preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying,0
23195,Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!,0
23196,For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet saying The voice of one crying in the wilderness Make ready the way of the Lord Make his paths straight,0
23197,Now John himself wore clothing made of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist His food was locusts and wild honey,0
23198,Then people from Jerusalem all of Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him,0
23199,They were baptized by him in the Jordan confessing their sins,0
23200,But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism he said to them You offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come,0
23201,Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!,0
23202,Dont think to yourselves We have Abraham for our father for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones,0
23203,Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees Therefore every tree that doesnt bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire,0
23204,I indeed baptize you in water for repentance but he who comes after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to carry He will baptize you in the Holy SpiritTR and NU add and with fire,0
23205,His winnowing fork is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor He will gather his wheat into the barn but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire,0
23206,Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him,0
23207,But John would have hindered him saying I need to be baptized by you and you come to me,0
23208,But Jesus answering said to him Allow it now for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness Then he allowed him,0
23209,Jesus when he was baptized went up directly from the water and behold the heavens were opened to him He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming on him,0
23210,Behold a voice out of the heavens said This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased,0
23211,Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil,0
23212,When he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was hungry afterward,0
23213,The tempter came and said to him If you are the Son of God command that these stones become bread,0
23214,But he answered It is written Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God,0
23215,Then the devil took him into the holy city He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,0
23216,and said to him If you are the Son of God throw yourself down for it is written He will give his angels charge concerning you and On their hands they will bear you up So that you dont dash your foot against a stone,0
23217,Jesus said to him Again it is written You shall not test the Lord your God,0
23218,Again the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,0
23219,He said to him I will give you all of these things if you will fall down and worship me,0
23220,Then Jesus said to him Get behind meTR and NU read Go away instead of Get behind me Satan! For it is written You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve,0
23221,Then the devil left him and behold angels came and ministered to him,0
23222,Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up he withdrew into Galilee,0
23223,Leaving Nazareth he came and lived in Capernaum which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,0
23224,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying,0
23225,The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali Toward the sea beyond the Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles,0
23226,The people who sat in darkness saw a great light To those who sat in the region and shadow of death To them light has dawned,0
23227,From that time Jesus began to preach and to say Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,0
23228,Walking by the sea of Galilee heTR reads Jesus instead of he saw two brothers Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen,0
23229,He said to them Come after me and I will make you fishers for men,0
23230,They immediately left their nets and followed him,0
23231,Going on from there he saw two other brothers James the son of Zebedee and John his brother in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets He called them,0
23232,They immediately left the boat and their father and followed him,0
23233,Jesus went about in all Galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people,0
23234,The report about him went out into all Syria They brought to him all who were sick afflicted with various diseases and torments possessed with demons epileptics and paralytics and he healed them,0
23235,Great multitudes from Galilee Decapolis Jerusalem Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him,0
23236,Seeing the multitudes he went up onto the mountain When he had sat down his disciples came to him,0
23237,He opened his mouth and taught them saying,0
23238,Blessed are the poor in spirit For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23239,Blessed are those who mourn For they shall be comforted,0
23240,Blessed are the gentle For they shall inherit the earth,0
23241,Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness For they shall be filled,0
23242,Blessed are the merciful For they shall obtain mercy,0
23243,Blessed are the pure in heart For they shall see God,0
23244,Blessed are the peacemakers For they shall be called children of God,0
23245,Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23246,Blessed are you when people reproach you persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake,0
23247,Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you,0
23248,You are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its flavor with what will it be salted It is then good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men,0
23249,You are the light of the world A city located on a hill cant be hidden,0
23250,Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket but on a stand and it shines to all who are in the house,0
23251,Even so let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven,0
23252,Dont think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets I didnt come to destroy but to fulfill,0
23253,For most assuredly I tell you until heaven and earth pass away not even one smallest letterliterally iota or one tiny pen strokeor serif shall in any way pass away from the law until all things are accomplished,0
23254,Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23255,For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23256,You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones You shall not murder and Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment,0
23257,But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whoever shall say to his brother RacaRaca is an Aramaic insult related to the word for empty and conveying the idea of emptyheadedness! shall be in danger of the council and whoever shall say You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of GehennaGehenna is another name for Hell that brings to mind an image of a burning garbage dump with dead bodies in it,0
23258,If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you,0
23259,leave your gift there before the altar and go your way First be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer your gift,0
23260,Agree with your adversary quickly while you are with him in the way lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge and the judge deliver you to the officer and you be cast into prison,0
23261,Most assuredly I tell you you shall by no means get out of there until you have paid the last pennyLiterally kodrantes A kodrantes was a small copper coin worth about 2 lepta widows mitesnot enough to buy very much of anything,0
23262,You have heard that it was said TR adds to the ancients You shall not commit adultery,0
23263,but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart,0
23264,If your right eye causes you to stumble pluck it out and throw it away from you For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna,0
23265,If your right hand causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away from you for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish and not your whole body be thrown into Gehenna,0
23266,It was also said Whoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorce,0
23267,but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife except for the cause of sexual immorality makes her an adulteress and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery,0
23268,Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time You shall not make false vows but shall perform to the Lord your vows,0
23269,but I tell you dont swear at all neither by heaven for it is the throne of God,0
23270,nor by the earth for it is the footstool of his feet nor by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King,0
23271,Neither shall you swear by your head for you cant make one hair white or black,0
23272,But let your Yes be Yes and your No be no Whatever is more than these is of the evil one,0
23273,You have heard that it was said An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,0
23274,But I tell you dont resist him who is evil but whoever strikes you on your right cheek turn to him the other also,0
23275,If anyone sues you to take away your coat let him have your cloak also,0
23276,Whoever compels you to go one mile go with him two,0
23277,Give to him who asks you and dont turn away him who desires to borrow from you,0
23278,You have heard that it was said You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy,0
23279,But I tell you love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,0
23280,that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust,0
23281,For if you love those who love you what reward do you have Dont even the tax collectors do the same,0
23282,If you only greet your friends what more do you do than others Dont even the tax collectors do the same,0
23283,Therefore you shall be perfect just as your Father in heaven is perfect,0
23284,Be careful that you dont do your charitable giving before men to be seen by them or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven,0
23285,Therefore when you do merciful deeds dont sound a trumpet before yourself as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may get glory from men Most assuredly I tell you they have received their reward,0
23286,But when you do merciful deeds dont let your left hand know what your right hand does,0
23287,so that your merciful deeds may be in secret then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly,0
23288,When you pray you shall not be as the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen by men Most assuredly I tell you they have received their reward,0
23289,But you when you pray enter into your inner chamber and having shut your door pray to your Father who is in secret and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly,0
23290,In praying dont use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking,0
23291,Therefore dont be like them for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him,0
23292,Pray like this Our Father in heaven may your name be kept holy,0
23293,Let your Kingdom come Let your will be done as in heaven so on earth,0
23294,Give us today our daily bread,0
23295,Forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors,0
23296,Bring us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one For yours is the Kingdom the power and the glory forever Amen,0
23297,For if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you,0
23298,But if you dont forgive men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,0
23299,Moreover when you fast dont be like the hypocrites with sad faces For they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting Most assuredly I tell you they have received their reward,0
23300,But you when you fast anoint your head and wash your face,0
23301,so that you are not seen by men to be fasting but by your Father who is in secret and your Father who sees in secret will reward you,0
23302,Dont lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break through and steal,0
23303,but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust consume and where thieves dont break through and steal,0
23304,for where your treasure is there your heart will be also,0
23305,The lamp of the body is the eye If therefore your eye is sound your whole body will be full of light,0
23306,But if your eye is evil your whole body will be full of darkness If therefore the light that is in you is darkness how great is the darkness!,0
23307,No one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other You cant serve both God and Mammon,0
23308,Therefore I tell you dont be anxious for your life what you will eat or what you will drink nor yet for your body what you will wear Isnt life more than food and the body more than clothing,0
23309,See the birds of the sky that they dont sow neither do they reap nor gather into barns Your heavenly Father feeds them Arent you of much more value than they,0
23310,Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to the measure of his life,0
23311,Why are you anxious about clothing Consider the lilies of the field how they grow They dont toil neither do they spin,0
23312,yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these,0
23313,But if God so clothes the grass of the field which today exists and tomorrow is thrown into the oven wont he much more clothe you you of little faith,0
23314,Therefore dont be anxious saying What will we eat What will we drink or With what will we be clothed,0
23315,For the Gentiles seek after all these things for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things,0
23316,But seek first Gods Kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well,0
23317,Therefore dont be anxious for tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself Each days own evil is sufficient,0
23318,Dont judge so that you wont be judged,0
23319,For with whatever judgment you judge you will be judged and with whatever measure you measure it will be measured to you,0
23320,Why do you see the speck that is in your brothers eye but dont consider the beam that is in your own eye,0
23321,Or how will you tell your brother Let me remove the speck from your eye and behold the beam is in your own eye,0
23322,You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brothers eye,0
23323,Dont give that which is holy to the dogs neither throw your pearls before the pigs lest perhaps they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces,0
23324,Ask and it will be given you Seek and you will find Knock and it will be opened for you,0
23325,For everyone who asks receives He who seeks finds To him who knocks it will be opened,0
23326,Or who is there among you who if his son asks him for bread will give him a stone,0
23327,Or if he asks for a fish who will give him a serpent,0
23328,If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!,0
23329,Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you you shall also do to them for this is the law and the prophets,0
23330,Enter in by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many are those who enter in by it,0
23331,HowTR reads Because instead of How narrow is the gate and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it,0
23332,Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves,0
23333,By their fruits you will know them Do you gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles,0
23334,Even so every good tree produces good fruit but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit,0
23335,A good tree cant produce evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit,0
23336,Every tree that doesnt grow good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,0
23337,Therefore by their fruits you will know them,0
23338,Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven,0
23339,Many will tell me in that day Lord Lord didnt we prophesy in your name in your name cast out demons and in your name do many mighty works,0
23340,Then I will tell them I never knew you Depart from me you who work iniquity,0
23341,Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine and does them I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on a rock,0
23342,The rain came down the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house and it didnt fall for it was founded on the rock,0
23343,Everyone who hears these words of mine and doesnt do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand,0
23344,The rain came down the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house and it felland great was its fall,0
23345,It happened when Jesus had finished saying these things that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,0
23346,for he taught them with authority and not like the scribes,0
23347,When he came down from the mountain great multitudes followed him,0
23348,Behold a leper came to him and worshiped him saying Lord if you want to you can make me clean,0
23349,Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying I want to Be made clean Immediately his leprosy was cleansed,0
23350,Jesus said to him See that you tell nobody but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded as a testimony to them,0
23351,When he came into Capernaum a centurion came to him asking him,0
23352,and saying Lord my servant lies in the house paralyzed grievously tormented,0
23353,Jesus said to him I will come and heal him,0
23354,The centurion answered Lord Im not worthy for you to come under my roof Just say the word and my servant will be healed,0
23355,For I am also a man under authority having under myself soldiers I tell this one Go and he goes and tell another Come and he comes and tell my servant Do this and he does it,0
23356,When Jesus heard it he marveled and said to those who followed Most assuredly I tell you I havent found so great a faith not even in Israel,0
23357,I tell you that many will come from the east and the west and will sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23358,but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth,0
23359,Jesus said to the centurion Go your way Let it be done for you as you have believed His servant was healed in that hour,0
23360,When Jesus came into Peters house he saw his wifes mother lying sick with a fever,0
23361,He touched her hand and the fever left her She got up and served himTR reads them instead of him,0
23362,When evening came they brought to him many possessed with demons He cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick,0
23363,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying He took our infirmities and bore our diseases,0
23364,Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him he gave the order to depart to the other side,0
23365,A scribe came and said to him Teacher I will follow you wherever you go,0
23366,Jesus said to him The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head,0
23367,Another of his disciples said to him Lord allow me first to go and bury my father,0
23368,But Jesus said to him Follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead,0
23369,When he got into a boat his disciples followed him,0
23370,Behold a great tempest arose in the sea so much that the boat was covered with the waves but he was asleep,0
23371,They came to him and woke him up saying Save us Lord! We are dying!,0
23372,He said to them Why are you fearful oh you of little faith Then he got up rebuked the wind and the sea and there was a great calm,0
23373,The men marveled saying What kind of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him,0
23374,When he came to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes two people possessed by demons met him there coming out of the tombs exceedingly fierce so that nobody could pass by that way,0
23375,Behold they cried out saying What do we have to do with you Jesus Son of God Have you come here to torment us before the time,0
23376,Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them,0
23377,The demons begged him saying If you cast us out permit us to go away into the herd of pigs,0
23378,He said to them Go! They came out and went into the herd of pigs and behold the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water,0
23379,Those who fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything including what happened to those who were possessed with demons,0
23380,Behold all the city came out to meet Jesus When they saw him they begged that he would depart from their borders,0
23381,He entered into a boat and crossed over and came into his own city,0
23382,Behold they brought to him a man who was paralyzed lying on a bed Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic Son cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you,0
23383,Behold some of the scribes said to themselves This man blasphemes,0
23384,Jesus knowing their thoughts said Why do you think evil in your hearts,0
23385,For which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up and walk,0
23386,But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins then he said to the paralytic Get up and take up your mat and go up to your house,0
23387,He arose and departed to his house,0
23388,But when the multitudes saw it they marveled and glorified God who had given such authority to men,0
23389,As Jesus passed by from there he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office He said to him Follow me He got up and followed him,0
23390,It happened as he sat in the house behold many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples,0
23391,When the Pharisees saw it they said to his disciples Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners,0
23392,When Jesus heard it he said to them Those who are healthy have no need for a physician but those who are sick do,0
23393,But you go and learn what this means I desire mercy and not sacrifice for I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance,0
23394,Then Johns disciples came to him saying Why do we and the Pharisees fast often but your disciples dont fast,0
23395,Jesus said to them Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast,0
23396,No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment for the patch would tear away from the garment and a worse hole is made,0
23397,Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins or else the skins would burst and the wine be spilled and the skins ruined No they put new wine into fresh wineskins and both are preserved,0
23398,While he told these things to them behold a ruler came and worshiped him saying My daughter has just died but come and lay your hand on her and she will live,0
23399,Jesus got up and followed him as did his disciples,0
23400,Behold a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him and touched the tassels of his garment,0
23401,for she said within herself If I just touch his garment I will be made well,0
23402,But Jesus turning around and seeing her said Daughter cheer up! Your faith has made you well And the woman was made well from that hour,0
23403,When Jesus came into the rulers house and saw the flute players and the crowd in noisy disorder,0
23404,he said to them Make room because the girl isnt dead but sleeping They were ridiculing him,0
23405,But when the crowd was put out he entered in took her by the hand and the girl arose,0
23406,The report of this went out into all that land,0
23407,As Jesus passed by from there two blind men followed him calling out and saying Have mercy on us son of David!,0
23408,When he had come into the house the blind men came to him Jesus said to them Do you believe that I am able to do this They told him Yes Lord,0
23409,Then he touched their eyes saying According to your faith be it done to you,0
23410,Their eyes were opened Jesus strictly charged them saying See that no one knows about this,0
23411,But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land,0
23412,As they went out behold a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him,0
23413,When the demon was cast out the mute man spoke The multitudes marveled saying Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!,0
23414,But the Pharisees said By the prince of the demons he casts out demons,0
23415,Jesus went about all the cities and the villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people,0
23416,But when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassedTR reads weary instead of harassed and scattered like sheep without a shepherd,0
23417,Then he said to his disciples The harvest indeed is plentiful but the laborers are few,0
23418,Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest,0
23419,He called to himself his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every disease and every sickness,0
23420,Now the names of the twelve apostles are these The first Simon who is called Peter Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee John his brother,0
23421,Philip Bartholomew Thomas Matthew the tax collector James the son of Alphaeus and Lebbaeus whose surname was Thaddaeus,0
23422,Simon the Canaanite and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him,0
23423,Jesus sent these twelve out and charged them saying Dont go among the Gentiles and dont enter into any city of the Samaritans,0
23424,Rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,0
23425,As you go preach saying The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!,0
23426,Heal the sick cleanse the lepersTR adds  raise the dead and cast out demons Freely you received so freely give,0
23427,Dont take any gold nor silver nor brass in your money belts,0
23428,Take no bag for your journey neither two coats nor shoes nor staff for the laborer is worthy of his food,0
23429,Into whatever city or village you enter find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you go on,0
23430,As you enter into the household greet it,0
23431,If the household is worthy let your peace come on it but if it isnt worthy let your peace return to you,0
23432,Whoever doesnt receive you nor hear your words as you go out of that house or that city shake off the dust from your feet,0
23433,Most assuredly I tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city,0
23434,Behold I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves,0
23435,But beware of men for they will deliver you up to councils and in their synagogues they will scourge you,0
23436,Yes and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles,0
23437,But when they deliver you up dont be anxious how or what you will say for it will be given you in that hour what you will say,0
23438,For it is not you who speak but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you,0
23439,Brother will deliver up brother to death and the father his child Children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death,0
23440,You will be hated by all men for my names sake but he who endures to the end will be saved,0
23441,But when they persecute you in this city flee into the next for most assuredly I tell you you will not have gone through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man has come,0
23442,A disciple is not above his teacher nor a servant above his lord,0
23443,It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher and the servant like his lord If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul how much more those of his household!,0
23444,Therefore dont be afraid of them for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed and hidden that will not be known,0
23445,What I tell you in the darkness speak in the light and what you hear whispered in the ear proclaim on the housetops,0
23446,Dont be afraid of those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul Rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna,0
23447,Arent two sparrows sold for an assarionAn assarion is a small coin worth one tenth of a drachma or a sixteenth of a denarius approximately the wages of one half hour of agricultural labor Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Fathers will,0
23448,but the very hairs of your head are all numbered,0
23449,Therefore dont be afraid You are of more value than many sparrows,0
23450,Everyone therefore who confesses me before men him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven,0
23451,But whoever denies me before men him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven,0
23452,Dont think that I came to send peace on the earth I didnt come to send peace but a sword,0
23453,For I came to set a man at odds against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw,0
23454,A mans foes will be those of his own household,0
23455,He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he who loves son or daughter more than me isnt worthy of me,0
23456,He who doesnt take his cross and follow after me isnt worthy of me,0
23457,He who finds his life will lose it and he who loses his life for my sake will find it,0
23458,He who receives you receives me and he who receives me receives him who sent me,0
23459,He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous mans reward,0
23460,Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple most assuredly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward,0
23461,It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities,0
23462,Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples,0
23463,and said to him Are you he who comes or should we look for another,0
23464,Jesus answered them Go and tell John the things which you hear and see,0
23465,the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them,0
23466,Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me,0
23467,As these went their way Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John What did you go out into the wilderness to see A reed shaken by the wind,0
23468,But what did you go out to see A man in soft clothing Behold those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses,0
23469,But why did you go out To see a prophet Yes I tell you and much more than a prophet,0
23470,For this is he of whom it is written Behold I send my messenger before your face who will prepare your way before you,0
23471,Most assuredly I tell you among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he,0
23472,From the days of John the Baptizer until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force,0
23473,For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John,0
23474,If you are willing to receive it this is Elijah who is to come,0
23475,He who has ears to hear let him hear,0
23476,But to what shall I compare this generation It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call to their companions,0
23477,and say We played the flute for you and you didnt dance We mourned for you and you didnt lament,0
23478,For John came neither eating nor drinking and they say He has a demon,0
23479,The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a gluttonous man and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her children,0
23480,Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done because they didnt repent,0
23481,Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes,0
23482,But I tell you it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you,0
23483,You Capernaum who are exalted to Heaven you will go down to Hades For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you it would have remained until this day,0
23484,But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you,0
23485,At that time Jesus answered I thank you Father Lord of heaven and earth that you hid these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to infants,0
23486,Yes Father for so it was wellpleasing in your sight,0
23487,All things have been delivered to me by my Father No one knows the Son except the Father neither does anyone know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him,0
23488,Come to me all you who labor and are heavily burdened and I will give you rest,0
23489,Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls,0
23490,For my yoke is easy and my burden is light,0
23491,At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat,0
23492,But the Pharisees when they saw it said to him Behold your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath,0
23493,But he said to them Havent you read what David did when he was hungry and those who were with him,0
23494,how he entered into the house of God and ate the show bread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for those who were with him but only for the priests,0
23495,Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless,0
23496,But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here,0
23497,But if you had known what this means I desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless,0
23498,For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath,0
23499,He departed there and went into their synagogue,0
23500,And behold there was a man with a withered hand They asked him Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day that they might accuse him,0
23501,He said to them What man is there among you who has one sheep and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day wont he grab on to it and lift it out,0
23502,Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day,0
23503,Then he told the man Stretch out your hand He stretched it out and it was restored whole just like the other,0
23504,But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him how they might destroy him,0
23505,Jesus perceiving that withdrew from there Great multitudes followed him and he healed them all,0
23506,and charged them that they should not make him known,0
23507,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying,0
23508,Behold my servant whom I have chosen My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased I will put my Spirit on him He will proclaim justice to the Gentiles,0
23509,He will not strive nor shout Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets,0
23510,He wont break a bruised reed He wont quench a smoking flax Until he leads justice to victory,0
23511,In his name the Gentiles will hope,0
23512,Then one possessed by a demon blind and mute was brought to him and he healed him so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw,0
23513,All the multitudes were amazed and said Can this be the son of David,0
23514,But when the Pharisees heard it they said This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul the prince of the demons,0
23515,Knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself will not stand,0
23516,If Satan casts out Satan he is divided against himself How then will his kingdom stand,0
23517,If I by Beelzebul cast out demons by whom do your children cast them out Therefore they will be your judges,0
23518,But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons then the Kingdom of God has come upon you,0
23519,Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first bind the strong man Then he will plunder his house,0
23520,He who is not with me is against me and he who doesnt gather with me scatters,0
23521,Therefore I tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men,0
23522,Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man it will be forgiven him but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit it will not be forgiven him neither in this age nor in that which is to come,0
23523,Either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt for the tree is known by its fruit,0
23524,You offspring of vipers how can you being evil speak good things For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,0
23525,The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things and the evil man out of his evil treasureTR adds of the heart brings out evil things,0
23526,I tell you that every idle word that men speak they will give account of it in the day of judgment,0
23527,For by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned,0
23528,Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered Teacher we want to see a sign from you,0
23529,But he answered them An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet,0
23530,For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth,0
23531,The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold someone greater than Jonah is here,0
23532,The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold someone greater than Solomon is here,0
23533,But the unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man passes through waterless places seeking rest and doesnt find it,0
23534,Then he says I will return into my house from which I came out and when he has come back he finds it empty swept and put in order,0
23535,Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is and they enter in and dwell there The last state of that man becomes worse than the first Even so will it be also to this evil generation,0
23536,While he was yet speaking to the multitudes behold his mother and his brothers stood outside seeking to speak to him,0
23537,One said to him Behold your mother and your brothers stand outside seeking to speak to you,0
23538,But he answered him who spoke to him Who is my mother Who are my brothers,0
23539,He stretched out his hand towards his disciples and said Behold my mother and my brothers!,0
23540,For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven he is my brother and sister and mother,0
23541,On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside,0
23542,Great multitudes gathered to him so that he entered into a boat and sat and all the multitude stood on the beach,0
23543,He spoke to them many things in parables saying Behold a farmer went out to sow,0
23544,As he sowed some seeds fell by the roadside and the birds came and devoured them,0
23545,Others fell on rocky ground where they didnt have much soil and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth,0
23546,When the sun had risen they were scorched Because they had no root they withered away,0
23547,Others fell among thorns The thorns grew up and choked them,0
23548,and others fell on good soil and yielded fruit some one hundred times as much some sixty and some thirty,0
23549,He who has ears to hear let him hear,0
23550,The disciples came and said to him Why do you speak to them in parables,0
23551,He answered them To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but it is not given to them,0
23552,For whoever has to him will be given and he will have abundance but whoever doesnt have from him will be taken away even that which he has,0
23553,Therefore I speak to them in parables because seeing they dont see and hearing they dont hear neither do they understand,0
23554,In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled which says  By hearing you will hear And will in no way understand Seeing you will see And will in no way perceive,0
23555,For this peoples heart has grown callous Their ears are dull of hearing They have closed their eyes Or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes Hear with their ears Understand with their heart And should turn again And I would heal them,0
23556,But blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear,0
23557,For most assuredly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see and didnt see them and to hear the things which you hear and didnt hear them,0
23558,Hear then the parable of the farmer,0
23559,When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesnt understand it the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart This is what was sown by the roadside,0
23560,What was sown on the rocky places this is he who hears the word and immediately with joy receives it,0
23561,yet he has no root in himself but endures for a while When oppression or persecution arises because of the word immediately he stumbles,0
23562,What was sown among the thorns this is he who hears the word but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becomes unfruitful,0
23563,What was sown on the good ground this is he who hears the word and understands it who most assuredly bears fruit and brings forth some one hundred times as much some sixty and some thirty,0
23564,He set another parable before them saying The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,0
23565,but while people slept his enemy came and sowed darneldarnel is a weed grass probably bearded darnel or lolium temulentum that looks very much like wheat until it is mature when the difference becomes very apparent also among the wheat and went away,0
23566,But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit then the darnel appeared also,0
23567,The servants of the householder came and said to him Sir didnt you sow good seed in your field Where did this darnel come from,0
23568,He said to them An enemy has done this The servants asked him Do you want us to go and gather them up,0
23569,But he said No lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel you root up the wheat with them,0
23570,Let both grow together until the harvest and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers First gather up the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn,0
23571,He set another parable before them saying The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field,0
23572,which indeed is smaller than all seeds But when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches,0
23573,He spoke another parable to them The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measuresLiterally satas 3 satas  about 05 bushel or 22 litres of meal until it was all leavened,0
23574,Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes and without a parable he didnt speak to them,0
23575,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying  I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world,0
23576,Then Jesus sent the multitudes away and went into the house His disciples came to him saying Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field,0
23577,He answered them He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,0
23578,the field is the world and the good seed these are the children of the Kingdom and the darnel are the children of the evil one,0
23579,The enemy who sowed them is the devil The harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels,0
23580,As therefore the darnel is gathered up and burned with fire so will it be at the end of this age,0
23581,The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and those who do iniquity,0
23582,and will cast them into the furnace of fire There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth,0
23583,Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father He who has ears to hear let him hear,0
23584,Again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid In his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field,0
23585,Again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,0
23586,who having found one pearl of great price he went and sold all that he had and bought it,0
23587,Again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some fish of every kind,0
23588,which when it was filled they drew up on the beach They sat down and gathered the good into containers but the bad they threw away,0
23589,So will it be in the end of the world The angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous,0
23590,and will cast them into the furnace of fire There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth,0
23591,Jesus said to them Have you understood all these things They answered him Yes Lord,0
23592,He said to them Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old things,0
23593,It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables he departed from there,0
23594,Coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue so that they were astonished and said Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works,0
23595,Isnt this the carpenters son Isnt his mother called Mary and his brothers James Joses Simon and Judas,0
23596,Arent all of his sisters with us Where then did this man get all of these things,0
23597,They were offended by him But Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house,0
23598,He didnt do many mighty works there because of their unbelief,0
23599,At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,0
23600,and said to his servants This is John the Baptizer He is risen from the dead That is why these powers work in him,0
23601,For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias his brother Philips wife,0
23602,For John said to him It is not lawful for you to have her,0
23603,When he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet,0
23604,But when Herods birthday came the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod,0
23605,Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask,0
23606,She being prompted by her mother said Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer,0
23607,The king was grieved but for the sake of his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him he commanded it to be given,0
23608,and he sent and beheaded John in the prison,0
23609,His head was brought on a platter and given to the young lady and she brought it to her mother,0
23610,His disciples came and took the body and buried it and they went and told Jesus,0
23611,Now when Jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place apart When the multitudes heard it they followed him on foot from the cities,0
23612,Jesus went out and he saw a great multitude He had compassion on them and healed their sick,0
23613,When evening had come his disciples came to him saying This place is deserted and the hour is already late Send the multitudes away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food,0
23614,But Jesus said to them They dont need to go away You give them something to eat,0
23615,They told him We only have here five loaves and two fish,0
23616,He said Bring them here to me,0
23617,He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass and he took the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he blessed broke and gave the loaves to the disciples and the disciples gave to the multitudes,0
23618,They all ate and were filled They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces,0
23619,Those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children,0
23620,Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and to go ahead of him to the other side while he sent the multitudes away,0
23621,After he had sent the multitudes away he went up into the mountain by himself to pray When evening had come he was there alone,0
23622,But the boat was now in the middle of the sea distressed by the waves for the wind was contrary,0
23623,In the fourth watch of the nightThe night was equally divided into four watches so the fourth watch is approximately 300 A M to sunrise Jesus came to them walking on the sea,0
23624,When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying Its a ghost! and they cried out for fear,0
23625,But immediately Jesus spoke to them saying Cheer up! I AM!see Exodus 314 Dont be afraid,0
23626,Peter answered him and said Lord if it is you command me to come to you on the waters,0
23627,He said Come! Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the waters to come to Jesus,0
23628,But when he saw that the wind was strong he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out saying Lord save me!,0
23629,Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand took hold of him and said to him You of little faith why did you doubt,0
23630,When they got up into the boat the wind ceased,0
23631,Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him saying You are truly the Son of God!,0
23632,When they had crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret,0
23633,When the men of that place recognized him they sent into all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick,0
23634,and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment As many as touched it were made whole,0
23635,Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem saying,0
23636,Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders For they dont wash their hands when they eat bread,0
23637,He answered them Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition,0
23638,For God commanded Honor your father and your mother and He who speaks evil of father or mother let him be put to death,0
23639,But you say Whoever may tell his father or his mother Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,0
23640,he shall not honor his father or mother You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition,0
23641,You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying,0
23642,These people draw near to me with their mouth And honor me with their lips But their heart is far from me,0
23643,And in vain do they worship me Teaching as doctrine rules made by men,0
23644,He summoned the multitude and said to them Hear and understand,0
23645,That which enters into the mouth doesnt defile the man but that which proceeds out of the mouth this defiles the man,0
23646,Then the disciples came and said to him Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying,0
23647,But he answered Every plant which my heavenly Father didnt plant will be uprooted,0
23648,Leave them alone They are blind guides of the blind If the blind guide the blind both will fall into a pit,0
23649,Peter answered him Explain the parable to us,0
23650,So Jesus said Do you also still not understand,0
23651,Dont you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body,0
23652,But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart and they defile the man,0
23653,For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts murders adulteries sexual sins thefts false testimony and blasphemies,0
23654,These are the things which defile the man but to eat with unwashed hands doesnt defile the man,0
23655,Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon,0
23656,Behold a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried saying Have mercy on me Lord you son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!,0
23657,But he answered her not a word His disciples came and begged him saying Send her away for she cries after us,0
23658,But he answered I wasnt sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel,0
23659,But she came and worshiped him saying Lord help me,0
23660,But he answered It is not appropriate to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs,0
23661,But she said Yes Lord but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters table,0
23662,Then Jesus answered her Woman great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire And her daughter was healed from that hour,0
23663,Jesus departed there and came near to the sea of Galilee and he went up into the mountain and sat there,0
23664,Great multitudes came to him having with them the lame blind mute maimed and many others and they put them down at his feet He healed them,0
23665,so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking injured whole lame walking and blind seeingand they glorified the God of Israel,0
23666,Jesus summoned his disciples and said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat I dont want to send them away fasting or they might faint on the way,0
23667,The disciples said to him Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude,0
23668,Jesus said to them How many loaves do you have They said Seven and a few small fish,0
23669,He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground,0
23670,and he took the seven loaves and the fish He gave thanks and broke them and gave to the disciples and the disciples to the multitudes,0
23671,They all ate and were filled They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over,0
23672,Those who ate were four thousand men besides women and children,0
23673,Then he sent away the multitudes got into the boat and came into the borders of Magdala,0
23674,The Pharisees and Sadducees came and testing him asked him to show them a sign from heaven,0
23675,But he answered them When it is evening you say It will be fair weather for the sky is red,0
23676,In the morning It will be foul weather today for the sky is red and threatening Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky but you cant discern the signs of the times!,0
23677,An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign and there will be no sign given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah He left them and departed,0
23678,The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread,0
23679,Jesus said to them Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,0
23680,They reasoned among themselves saying We brought no bread,0
23681,Jesus perceiving it said Why do you reason among yourselves you of little faith because you have brought no bread,0
23682,Dont you yet perceive neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you took up,0
23683,Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up,0
23684,How is it that you dont perceive that I didnt speak to you concerning bread But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,0
23685,Then they understood that he didnt tell them to beware of the yeast of bread but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees,0
23686,Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying Who do men say that I the Son of Man am,0
23687,They said Some say John the Baptizer some Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets,0
23688,He said to them But who do you say that I am,0
23689,Simon Peter answered You are the Christ the Son of the living God,0
23690,Jesus answered him Blessed are you Simon Bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father who is in heaven,0
23691,I also tell you that you are PeterPeters name Petros in Greek is the word for a specific rock or stone and on this rockGreek petra a rock mass or bedrock I will build my assembly and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it,0
23692,I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven,0
23693,Then he charged the disciples that they should tell no one that he is Jesus the Christ,0
23694,From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third day be raised up,0
23695,Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying Far be it from you Lord! This will never be done to you,0
23696,But he turned and said to Peter Get behind me Satan! You are a stumblingblock to me for you are not setting your mind on the things of God but on the things of men,0
23697,Then Jesus said to his disciples If anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me,0
23698,For whoever desires to save his life will lose it and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it,0
23699,For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life Or what will a man give in exchange for his life,0
23700,For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds,0
23701,Most assuredly I tell you there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom,0
23702,After six days Jesus took with him Peter James and John his brother and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves,0
23703,He was transfigured before them His face shone like the sun and his garments became as white as the light,0
23704,Behold Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him,0
23705,Peter answered and said to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here If you want lets make three tents here one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah,0
23706,While he was still speaking behold a bright cloud overshadowed them Behold a voice came out of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased Listen to him,0
23707,When the disciples heard it they fell on their faces and were very afraid,0
23708,Jesus came and touched them and said Get up and dont be afraid,0
23709,Lifting up their eyes they saw no one except Jesus alone,0
23710,As they were coming down from the mountain Jesus commanded them saying Dont tell anyone what you saw until the Son of Man has risen from the dead,0
23711,His disciples asked him saying Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first,0
23712,Jesus answered them Elijah indeed comes first and will restore all things,0
23713,but I tell you that Elijah has come already and they didnt recognize him but did to him whatever they wanted to Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them,0
23714,Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer,0
23715,When they came to the multitude a man came to him kneeling down to him saying,0
23716,Lord have mercy on my son for he is epileptic and suffers grievously for he often falls into the fire and often into the water,0
23717,So I brought him to your disciples and they could not cure him,0
23718,Jesus answered Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you How long will I bear with you Bring him here to me,0
23719,Jesus rebuked him the demon went out of him and the boy was cured from that hour,0
23720,Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said Why werent we able to cast it out,0
23721,He said to them Because of your unbelief For most assuredly I tell you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you will tell this mountain Move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you,0
23722,But this kind doesnt go out except by prayer and fasting,0
23723,While they were staying in Galilee Jesus said to them The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,0
23724,and they will kill him and the third day he will be raised up They were exceedingly sorry,0
23725,When they had come to Capernaum those who collected the didrachma coinsA didrachma is a Greek silver coin worth 2 drachmas about as much as 2 Roman denarii or about 2 days wages It was commonly used to pay the halfshekel temple tax because 2 drachmas were worth one half shekel of silver came to Peter and said Doesnt your teacher pay the didrachma,0
23726,He said Yes When he came into the house Jesus anticipated him saying What do you think Simon From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute From their children or from strangers,0
23727,Peter said to him From strangers Jesus said to him Therefore the children are exempt,0
23728,But lest we cause them to stumble go to the sea and cast a hook and take up the first fish that comes up When you have opened its mouth you will find a stater coinA stater is a silver coin equivalent to four Attic or two Alexandrian drachmas or a Jewish shekel just exactly enough to cover the halfshekel Temple Tax for two people Take that and give it to them for me and you,0
23729,In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23730,Jesus called a little child to himself and set him in the midst of them,0
23731,and said Most assuredly I tell you unless you turn and become as little children you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23732,Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23733,Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,0
23734,but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea,0
23735,Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!,0
23736,If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and cast it from you It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire,0
23737,If your eye causes you to stumble pluck it out and cast it from you It is better for you to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehennaor Hell of fire,0
23738,See that you dont despise one of these little ones for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven,0
23739,For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost,0
23740,What do you think If a man has one hundred sheep and one of them goes astray doesnt he leave the ninetynine go to the mountains and seek that which has gone astray,0
23741,If he finds it most assuredly I tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine which have not gone astray,0
23742,Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish,0
23743,If your brother sins against you go show him his fault between you and him alone If he listens to you you have gained back your brother,0
23744,But if he doesnt listen take one or two more with you that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established,0
23745,If he refuses to listen to them tell it to the assembly If he refuses to hear the assembly also let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector,0
23746,Most assuredly I tell you whatever things you will bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever things you will release on earth will be released in heaven,0
23747,Again assuredly I tell you that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven,0
23748,For where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them,0
23749,Then Peter came and said to him Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him Until seven times,0
23750,Jesus said to him I dont tell you until seven times but until seventy times seven,0
23751,Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants,0
23752,When he had begun to reconcile one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talentsTen thousand talents represents an extremely large sum of money equivalent to about 60000000 denarii where one denarius was typical of one days wages for agricultural labor,0
23753,But because he couldnt pay his lord commanded him to be sold with his wife his children and all that he had and payment to be made,0
23754,The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him saying Lord have patience with me and I will repay you all!,0
23755,The lord of that servant being moved with compassion released him and forgave him the debt,0
23756,But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred denarii100 denarii was about one sixtieth of a talent and he grabbed him and took him by the throat saying Pay me what you owe!,0
23757,So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him saying Have patience with me and I will repay you!,0
23758,He would not but went and cast him into prison until he should pay back that which was due,0
23759,So when his fellow servants saw what was done they were exceedingly sorry and came and told to their lord all that was done,0
23760,Then his lord called him in and said to him You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me,0
23761,Shouldnt you also have had mercy on your fellow servant even as I had mercy on you,0
23762,His lord was angry and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due to him,0
23763,So my heavenly Father will also do to you if you dont each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds,0
23764,It happened when Jesus had finished these words he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan,0
23765,Great multitudes followed him and he healed them there,0
23766,Pharisees came to him testing him and saying Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason,0
23767,He answered Havent you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,0
23768,and said For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall join to his wife and the two shall become one flesh,0
23769,So that they are no more two but one flesh What therefore God has joined together dont let man tear apart,0
23770,They asked him Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce and divorce her,0
23771,He said to them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts allowed you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it has not been so,0
23772,I tell you that whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery,0
23773,His disciples said to him If this is the case of the man with his wife it is not expedient to marry,0
23774,But he said to them Not all men can receive this saying but those to whom it is given,0
23775,For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers womb and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heavens sake He who is able to receive it let him receive it,0
23776,Then little children were brought to him that he should lay his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them,0
23777,But Jesus said Allow the little children and dont forbid them to come to me for to such belongs the Kingdom of Heaven,0
23778,He laid his hands on them and departed from there,0
23779,Behold one came to him and said Good teacher what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life,0
23780,He said to him Why do you call me good No one is good but one that is God But if you want to enter into life keep the commandments,0
23781,He said to him Which ones Jesus said You shall not murder You shall not commit adultery You shall not steal You shall not offer false testimony,0
23782,Honor your father and mother And You shall love your neighbor as yourself,0
23783,The young man said to him All these things I have observed from my youth What do I still lack,0
23784,Jesus said to him If you want to be perfect go sell what you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me,0
23785,But when the young man heard the saying he went away sad for he was one who had great possessions,0
23786,Jesus said to his disciples Most assuredly I say to you a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty,0
23787,Again I tell you it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God,0
23788,When the disciples heard it they were exceedingly astonished saying Who then can be saved,0
23789,Looking at them Jesus said With men this is impossible but with God all things are possible,0
23790,Then Peter answered Behold we have left everything and followed you What then will we have,0
23791,Jesus said to them Most assuredly I tell you that you who have followed me in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel,0
23792,Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake will receive one hundred times and will inherit eternal life,0
23793,But many will be last who are first and first who are last,0
23794,For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard,0
23795,When he had agreed with the laborers for a denariusA denarius is a silver Roman coin worth 125th of a Roman aureus This was a common wage for a day of farm labor a day he sent them into his vineyard,0
23796,He went out about the third hourTime was measured from sunrise to sunset so the third hour would be about 900 AM and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,0
23797,To them he said You also go into the vineyard and whatever is right I will give you So they went their way,0
23798,Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hournoon and 300 P M and did likewise,0
23799,About the eleventh hour500 PM he went out and found others standing idle He said to them Why do you stand here all day idle,0
23800,They said to him Because no one has hired us He said to them You also go into the vineyard and you will receive whatever is right,0
23801,When evening had come the lord of the vineyard said to his steward Call the laborers and pay them their wages beginning from the last to the first,0
23802,When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came they each received a denarius,0
23803,When the first came they supposed that they would receive more and they likewise each received a denarius,0
23804,When they received it they murmured against the master of the household,0
23805,saying These last have spent one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!,0
23806,But he answered one of them Friend I am doing you no wrong Didnt you agree with me for a denarius,0
23807,Take that which is yours and go your way It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you,0
23808,Isnt it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own Or is your eye evil because I am good,0
23809,So the last will be first and the first last For many are called but few are chosen,0
23810,As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside and on the way he said to them,0
23811,Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death,0
23812,and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock to scourge and to crucify and the third day he will be raised up,0
23813,Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons kneeling and asking a certain thing of him,0
23814,He said to her What do you want She said to him Command that these my two sons may sit one on your right hand and one on your left hand in your Kingdom,0
23815,But Jesus answered You dont know what you are asking Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with They said to him We are able,0
23816,He said to them You will indeed drink my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father,0
23817,When the ten heard it they were indignant with the two brothers,0
23818,But Jesus summoned them and said You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them,0
23819,It shall not be so among you but whoever desires to become great among you shall beTR reads let him be instead of shall be your servant,0
23820,Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,0
23821,even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many,0
23822,As they went out from Jericho a great multitude followed him,0
23823,Behold two blind men sitting by the road when they heard that Jesus was passing by cried out Lord have mercy on us you son of David!,0
23824,The multitude rebuked them telling them that they should be quiet but they cried out even more Lord have mercy on us you son of David!,0
23825,Jesus stood still and called them and asked What do you want me to do for you,0
23826,They told him Lord that our eyes may be opened,0
23827,Jesus being moved with compassion touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received their sight and they followed him,0
23828,When they drew near to Jerusalem and came to BethsphageTR reads Bethphage instead of Bethsphage to the Mount of Olives then Jesus sent two disciples,0
23829,saying to them Go into the village that is opposite you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her Untie them and bring them to me,0
23830,If anyone says anything to you you shall say The Lord needs them and immediately he will send them,0
23831,All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying,0
23832,Tell the daughter of Zion Behold your King comes to you Humble and riding on a donkey On a colt the foal of a donkey,0
23833,The disciples went and did just as Jesus commanded them,0
23834,and brought the donkey and the colt and laid their clothes on them and he sat on them,0
23835,A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road,0
23836,The multitudes who went before him and who followed kept shouting Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!,0
23837,When he had come into Jerusalem all the city was stirred up saying Who is this,0
23838,The multitudes said This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee,0
23839,Jesus entered into the temple of God and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the moneychangers tables and the seats of those who sold the doves,0
23840,He said to them It is written My house shall be called a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers!,0
23841,The blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them,0
23842,But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children who were crying in the temple and saying Hosanna to the son of David! they were indignant,0
23843,and said to him Do you hear what these are saying Jesus said to them Yes Did you never read Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise,0
23844,He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there,0
23845,Now in the morning as he returned to the city he was hungry,0
23846,Seeing a fig tree by the road he came to it and found nothing on it but leaves He said to it Let there be no fruit from you forever! Immediately the fig tree withered away,0
23847,When the disciples saw it they marveled saying How did the fig tree immediately wither away,0
23848,Jesus answered them Most assuredly I tell you if you have faith and dont doubt you will not only do what is done to the fig tree but even if you told this mountain Be taken up and cast into the sea it would be done,0
23849,All things whatever you ask in prayer believing you will receive,0
23850,When he had come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said By what authority do you do these things Who gave you this authority,0
23851,Jesus answered them I also will ask you one question which if you tell me I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things,0
23852,The baptism of John where was it from From heaven or from men They reasoned with themselves saying If we say From heaven he will ask us Why then did you not believe him,0
23853,But if we say From men we fear the multitude for all hold John as a prophet,0
23854,They answered Jesus and said We dont know He also said to them Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things,0
23855,But what do you think A man had two sons and he came to the first and said Son go work today in my vineyard,0
23856,He answered I will not but afterward he changed his mind and went,0
23857,He came to the second and said the same thing He answered I go sir but he didnt go,0
23858,Which of the two did the will of his father They said to him The first Jesus said to them Most assuredly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you,0
23859,For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you didnt believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him When you saw it you didnt even repent afterward that you might believe him,0
23860,Hear another parable There was a man who was a master of a household who planted a vineyard set a hedge about it dug a winepress in it built a tower leased it out to farmers and went into another country,0
23861,When the season for the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruit,0
23862,The farmers took his servants beat one killed another and stoned another,0
23863,Again he sent other servants more than the first and they treated them the same way,0
23864,But afterward he sent to them his son saying They will respect my son,0
23865,But the farmers when they saw the son said among themselves This is the heir Come lets kill him and seize his inheritance,0
23866,So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,0
23867,When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes what will he do to those farmers,0
23868,They told him He will miserably destroy those miserable men and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in its season,0
23869,Jesus said to them Did you never read in the Scriptures The stone which the builders rejected The same was made the head of the corner This was from the Lord It is marvelous in our eyes,0
23870,Therefore I tell you the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruits,0
23871,He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces but on whoever it will fall it will scatter him as dust,0
23872,When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables they perceived that he spoke about them,0
23873,When they sought to seize him they feared the multitudes because they considered him to be a prophet,0
23874,Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them saying,0
23875,The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who made a marriage feast for his son,0
23876,and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast but they would not come,0
23877,Again he sent out other servants saying Tell those who are invited Behold I have made ready my dinner My oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready Come to the marriage feast!,0
23878,But they made light of it and went their ways one to his own farm another to his merchandise,0
23879,and the rest grabbed his servants and treated them shamefully and killed them,0
23880,When the king heard that he was angry and he sent his armies destroyed those murderers and burned their city,0
23881,Then he said to his servants The wedding is ready but those who were invited werent worthy,0
23882,Go therefore to the intersections of the highways and as many as you may find invite to the marriage feast,0
23883,Those servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found both bad and good The wedding was filled with guests,0
23884,But when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man who didnt have on wedding clothing,0
23885,and he said to him Friend how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing He was speechless,0
23886,Then the king said to the servants Bind him hand and foot take him away and throw him into the outer darkness there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be,0
23887,For many are called but few chosen,0
23888,Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk,0
23889,They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians saying Teacher we know that you are honest and teach the way of God in truth no matter who you teach for you arent partial to anyone,0
23890,Tell us therefore what do you think Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not,0
23891,But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said Why do you test me you hypocrites,0
23892,Show me the tax money They brought to him a denarius,0
23893,He asked them Whose is this image and inscription,0
23894,They said to him Caesars Then he said to them Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are Gods,0
23895,When they heard it they marveled and left him and went away,0
23896,On that day Sadducees those who say that there is no resurrection came to him They asked him,0
23897,saying Teacher Moses said If a man dies having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed for his brother,0
23898,Now there were with us seven brothers The first married and died and having no seed left his wife to his brother,0
23899,In like manner the second also and the third to the seventh,0
23900,After them all the woman died,0
23901,In the resurrection therefore whose wife will she be of the seven For they all had her,0
23902,But Jesus answered them You are mistaken not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God,0
23903,For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like Gods angels in heaven,0
23904,But concerning the resurrection of the dead havent you read that which was spoken to you by God saying,0
23905,I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob God is not the God of the dead but of the living,0
23906,When the multitudes heard it they were astonished at his teaching,0
23907,But the Pharisees when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence gathered themselves together,0
23908,One of them a lawyer asked him a question testing him,0
23909,Teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law,0
23910,Jesus said to him You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind,0
23911,This is the first and great commandment,0
23912,A second likewise is this You shall love your neighbor as yourself,0
23913,The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments,0
23914,Now while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them a question,0
23915,saying What do you think of the Christ Whose son is he They said to him Of David,0
23916,He said to them How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord saying,0
23917,The Lord said to my Lord Sit on my right hand Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet,0
23918,If then David calls him Lord how is he his son,0
23919,No one was able to answer him a word neither dared any man from that day forth ask him any more questions,0
23920,Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,0
23921,saying The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses seat,0
23922,All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe observe and do but dont do their works for they say and dont do,0
23923,For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them,0
23924,But all their works they do to be seen by men They make their phylacteries broad enlarge the fringes of their garments,0
23925,and love the place of honor at feasts the best seats in the synagogues,0
23926,the salutations in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi Rabbi by men,0
23927,But dont you be called Rabbi for one is your teacher the Christ and all of you are brothers,0
23928,Call no man on the earth your father for one is your Father he who is in heaven,0
23929,Neither be called masters for one is your master the Christ,0
23930,But he who is greatest among you will be your servant,0
23931,Whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted,0
23932,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you devour widows houses and as a pretense you make long prayers Therefore you will receive greater condemnation,0
23933,But woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for you dont enter in yourselves neither do you allow those who are entering in to enterSome Greek manuscripts reverse the order of verses 13 and 14 and some omit verse 13 numbering verse 14 as 13,0
23934,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte and when he becomes one you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna as yourselves,0
23935,Woe to you you blind guides who say Whoever swears by the temple it is nothing but whoever swears by the gold of the temple he is obligated,0
23936,You blind fools! For which is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold,0
23937,Whoever swears by the altar it is nothing but whoever swears by the gift that is on it he is obligated,0
23938,You blind fools! For which is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift,0
23939,He therefore who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it,0
23940,He who swears by the temple swears by it and by him who was living in it,0
23941,He who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits on it,0
23942,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you tithe mint dill and cumin cumin is an aromatic seed from Cuminum cyminum resembling caraway in flavor and appearance It is used as a spice and have left undone the weightier matters of the law justice mercy and faith But you ought to have done these and not to have left the other undone,0
23943,You blind guides who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!,0
23944,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousnessTR reads selfindulgence instead of unrighteousness,0
23945,You blind Pharisee first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter that the outside of it may become clean also,0
23946,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly are full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness,0
23947,Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity,0
23948,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous,0
23949,and say If we had lived in the days of our fathers we wouldnt have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets,0
23950,Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets,0
23951,Fill up then the measure of your fathers,0
23952,You serpents you offspring of vipers how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna,0
23953,Therefore behold I send to you prophets wise men and scribes Some of them you will kill and crucify and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,0
23954,that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar,0
23955,Most assuredly I tell you all these things will come upon this generation,0
23956,Jerusalem Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often would I have gathered your children together even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings and you would not!,0
23957,Behold your house is left to you desolate,0
23958,For I tell you you will not see me from now on until you say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!,0
23959,Jesus went out from the temple and was going on his way His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple,0
23960,But he answered them Dont you see all of these things Most assuredly I tell you there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down,0
23961,As he sat on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately saying Tell us when will these things be What is the sign of your coming and of the end of the age,0
23962,Jesus answered them Be careful that no one leads you astray,0
23963,For many will come in my name saying I am the Christ and will lead many astray,0
23964,You will hear of wars and rumors of wars See that you arent troubled for all this must happen but the end is not yet,0
23965,For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines plagues and earthquakes in various places,0
23966,But all these things are the beginning of birth pains,0
23967,Then they will deliver you up to oppression and will kill you You will be hated by all of the nations for my names sake,0
23968,Then many will stumble and will deliver up one another and will hate one another,0
23969,Many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray,0
23970,Because iniquity will be multiplied the love of many will grow cold,0
23971,But he who endures to the end the same will be saved,0
23972,This Gospel of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations and then the end will come,0
23973,When therefore you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place let the reader understand,0
23974,then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,0
23975,Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house,0
23976,Let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes,0
23977,But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!,0
23978,Pray that your flight will not be in the winter nor on a Sabbath,0
23979,for then there will be great oppression such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now no nor ever will be,0
23980,Unless those days had been shortened no flesh would have been saved But for the sake of the chosen ones those days will be shortened,0
23981,Then if any man tells you Behold here is the Christ or There dont believe it,0
23982,For there will arise false christs and false prophets and they will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray if possible even the chosen ones,0
23983,Behold I have told you beforehand,0
23984,If therefore they tell you Behold he is in the wilderness dont go out Behold he is in the inner chambers dont believe it,0
23985,For as the lightning comes forth from the east and is seen even to the west so will be the coming of the Son of Man,0
23986,For wherever the carcass is there will the vulturesor eagles be gathered together,0
23987,But immediately after the oppression of those days the sun will be darkened the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken,0
23988,and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory,0
23989,He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds from one end of the sky to the other,0
23990,Now from the fig tree learn this parable When its branch has now become tender and puts forth its leaves you know that the summer is near,0
23991,Even so you also when you see all these things know that it is near even at the doors,0
23992,Most assuredly I tell you this generationThe word for generation genea can also be translated as race will not pass away until all these things are accomplished,0
23993,Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away,0
23994,But no one knows of that day and hour not even the angels of heaven but my Father only,0
23995,As the days of Noah were so will be the coming of the Son of Man,0
23996,For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark,0
23997,and they didnt know until the flood came and took them all away so will be the coming of the Son of Man,0
23998,Then two men will be in the field one will be taken and one will be left,0
23999,two women grinding at the mill one will be taken and one will be left,0
24000,Watch therefore for you dont know in what hour your Lord comes,0
24001,But know this that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into,0
24002,Therefore also be ready for in an hour that you dont expect the Son of Man will come,0
24003,Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his lord has set over his household to give them their food in due season,0
24004,Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes,0
24005,Most assuredly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has,0
24006,But if that evil servant should say in his heart My lord is delaying his coming,0
24007,and begins to beat his fellowservants and eat and drink with the drunken,0
24008,the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesnt expect it and in an hour when he doesnt know it,0
24009,and will cut him in pieces and appoint his portion with the hypocrites there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be,0
24010,Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom,0
24011,Five of them were foolish and five were wise,0
24012,Those who were foolish when they took their lamps took no oil with them,0
24013,but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps,0
24014,Now while the bridegroom delayed they all slumbered and slept,0
24015,But at midnight there was a cry Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!,0
24016,Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps,0
24017,The foolish said to the wise Give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out,0
24018,But the wise answered saying What if there isnt enough for us and you You go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves,0
24019,While they went away to buy the bridegroom came and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut,0
24020,Afterward the other virgins also came saying Lord Lord open to us,0
24021,But he answered Most assuredly I tell you I dont know you,0
24022,Watch therefore for you dont know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming,0
24023,For it is like a man going into another country who called his own servants and entrusted his goods to them,0
24024,To one he gave five talents to another two to another one to each according to his own ability Then he went on his journey,0
24025,Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them and made another five talents,0
24026,In like manner he also who got the two gained another two,0
24027,But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth and hid his lords money,0
24028,Now after a long time the lord of those servants came and reconciled accounts with them,0
24029,He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents saying Lord you delivered to me five talents Behold I have gained another five talents besides them,0
24030,His lord said to him Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful over a few things I will set you over many things Enter into the joy of your lord,0
24031,He also who got the two talents came and said Lord you delivered to me two talents Behold I have gained another two talents besides them,0
24032,His lord said to him Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful over a few things I will set you over many things Enter into the joy of your lord,0
24033,He also who had received the one talent came and said Lord I knew you that you are a hard man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter,0
24034,I was afraid and went away and hid your talent in the earth Behold you have what is yours,0
24035,But his lord answered him You wicked and slothful servant You knew that I reap where I didnt sow and gather where I didnt scatter,0
24036,You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest,0
24037,Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents,0
24038,For to everyone who has will be given and he will have abundance but from him who has not even that which he has will be taken away,0
24039,Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,0
24040,But when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the holy angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory,0
24041,Before him all the nations will be gathered and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats,0
24042,He will set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left,0
24043,Then the King will tell those on his right hand Come blessed of my Father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,0
24044,for I was hungry and you gave me food to eat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in,0
24045,naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came to me,0
24046,Then the righteous will answer him saying Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you a drink,0
24047,When did we see you as a stranger and take you in or naked and clothe you,0
24048,When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you,0
24049,The King will answer them Most assuredly I tell you inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothersThe word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings you did it to me,0
24050,Then he will say also to those on the left hand Depart from me you cursed into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels,0
24051,for I was hungry and you didnt give me food to eat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,0
24052,I was a stranger and you didnt take me in naked and you didnt clothe me sick and in prison and you didnt visit me,0
24053,Then they will also answer saying Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and didnt help you,0
24054,Then he will answer them saying Most assuredly I tell you inasmuch as you didnt do it to one of the least of these you didnt do it to me,0
24055,These will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life,0
24056,It happened when Jesus had finished all these words that he said to his disciples,0
24057,You know that after two days the Passover is coming and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified,0
24058,Then the chief priests the scribes and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest who was called Caiaphas,0
24059,They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit and kill him,0
24060,But they said Not during the feast lest a riot occur among the people,0
24061,Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,0
24062,a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table,0
24063,But when his disciples saw this they were indignant saying Why this waste,0
24064,For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor,0
24065,But Jesus knowing this said to them Why do you trouble the woman Because she has done a good work for me,0
24066,For you always have the poor with you but you dont always have me,0
24067,For in pouring this ointment on my body she did it to prepare me for burial,0
24068,Most assuredly I tell you wherever this Gospel is preached in the whole world what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her,0
24069,Then one of the twelve who was called Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests,0
24070,and said What are you willing to give me that I should deliver him to you They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver,0
24071,From that time he sought opportunity to betray him,0
24072,Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus saying to him Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover,0
24073,He said Go into the city to a certain person and tell him The Teacher says My time is at hand I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples,0
24074,The disciples did as Jesus commanded them and they prepared the Passover,0
24075,Now when evening had come he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples,0
24076,As they were eating he said Most assuredly I tell you that one of you will betray me,0
24077,They were exceedingly sorrowful and each began to ask him It isnt me is it Lord,0
24078,He answered He who dipped his hand with me in the dish the same will betray me,0
24079,The Son of Man goes even as it is written of him but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born,0
24080,Judas who betrayed him answered It isnt me is it Rabbi He said to him You said it,0
24081,As they were eating Jesus took bread gave thanks forTR reads blessed instead of gave thanks for it and broke it He gave to the disciples and said Take eat this is my body,0
24082,He took the cup gave thanks and gave to them saying All of you drink it,0
24083,for this is my blood of the new covenant which is poured out for many for the remission of sins,0
24084,But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Fathers Kingdom,0
24085,When they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives,0
24086,Then Jesus said to them All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered,0
24087,But after I am raised up I will go before you into Galilee,0
24088,But Peter answered him Even if all will be made to stumble because of you I will never be made to stumble,0
24089,Jesus said to him Most assuredly I tell you that tonight before the rooster crows you will deny me three times,0
24090,Peter said to him Even if I must die with you I will not deny you All of the disciples also said likewise,0
24091,Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane and said to his disciples Sit here while I go there and pray,0
24092,He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled,0
24093,Then he said to them My soul is exceedingly sorrowful even to death Stay here and watch with me,0
24094,He went forward a little fell on his face and prayed saying My Father if it is possible let this cup pass away from me nevertheless not what I desire but what you desire,0
24095,He came to the disciples and found them sleeping and said to Peter What couldnt you watch with me for one hour,0
24096,Watch and pray that you dont enter into temptation The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,0
24097,Again a second time he went away and prayed saying My Father if this cup cant pass away from me unless I drink it your desire be done,0
24098,He came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy,0
24099,He left them again went away and prayed a third time saying the same words,0
24100,Then he came to his disciples and said to them Sleep on now and take your rest Behold the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners,0
24101,Arise lets be going Behold he who betrays me is at hand,0
24102,While he was still speaking behold Judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priest and elders of the people,0
24103,Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign saying Whoever I kiss he is the one Seize him,0
24104,Immediately he came to Jesus and said Hail Rabbi! and kissed him,0
24105,Jesus said to him Friend why are you here Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took him,0
24106,Behold one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and struck off his ear,0
24107,Then Jesus said to him Put your sword back into its place for all those who take the sword will die by the sword,0
24108,Or do you think that I couldnt ask my Father and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels,0
24109,How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so,0
24110,In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me I sat daily in the temple teaching and you didnt arrest me,0
24111,But all this has happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled Then all the disciples left him and fled,0
24112,Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were gathered together,0
24113,But Peter followed him from a distance to the court of the high priest and entered in and sat with the officers to see the end,0
24114,Now the chief priests the elders and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,0
24115,and they found none Even though many false witnesses came forward they found none But at last two false witnesses came forward,0
24116,and said This man said I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days,0
24117,The high priest stood up and said to him Have you no answer What is this that these testify against you,0
24118,But Jesus held his peace The high priest answered him I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God,0
24119,Jesus said to him You have said it Nevertheless I tell you henceforth you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of the sky,0
24120,Then the high priest tore his clothing saying He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses Behold now you have heard his blasphemy,0
24121,What do you think They answered He is worthy of death!,0
24122,Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists and some slapped him,0
24123,saying Prophesy to us you Christ! Who hit you,0
24124,Now Peter was sitting outside in the court and a maid came to him saying You were also with Jesus the Galilean!,0
24125,But he denied it before them all saying I dont know what you are talking about,0
24126,When he had gone out onto the porch someone else saw him and said to those who were there This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth,0
24127,Again he denied it with an oath I dont know the man,0
24128,After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter Surely you are also one of them for your speech makes you known,0
24129,Then he began to curse and to swear I dont know the man! Immediately the rooster crowed,0
24130,Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times He went out and wept bitterly,0
24131,Now when morning had come all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death,0
24132,and they bound him and led him away and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate the governor,0
24133,Then Judas who betrayed him when he saw that Jesus was condemned felt remorse and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,0
24134,saying I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood But they said What is that to us You see to it,0
24135,He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary and departed He went away and hanged himself,0
24136,The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said Its not lawful to put them into the treasury since it is the price of blood,0
24137,They took counsel and bought the potters field with them to bury strangers in,0
24138,Therefore that field was called The Field of Blood to this day,0
24139,Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled saying They took the thirty pieces of silver The price of him upon whom a price had been set Whom some of the children of Israel priced,0
24140,And they gave them for the potters field As the Lord commanded me,0
24141,Now Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying Are you the King of the Jews Jesus said to him So you say,0
24142,When he was accused by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing,0
24143,Then Pilate said to him Dont you hear how many things they testify against you,0
24144,He gave him no answer not even one word so that the governor marveled greatly,0
24145,Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they desired,0
24146,They had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas,0
24147,When therefore they were gathered together Pilate said to them Whom do you want me to release to you Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ,0
24148,For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up,0
24149,While he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent to him saying Have nothing to do with that righteous man for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him,0
24150,Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus,0
24151,But the governor answered them Which of the two do you want me to release to you They said Barabbas!,0
24152,Pilate said to them What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ They all said to him Let him be crucified!,0
24153,But the governor said Why What evil has he done But they cried out exceedingly saying Let him be crucified!,0
24154,So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained but rather that a disturbance was starting he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person You see to it,0
24155,All the people answered May his blood be on us and on our children!,0
24156,Then he released to them Barabbas but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified,0
24157,Then the governors soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison together against him,0
24158,They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,0
24159,They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and a reed in his right hand and they kneeled down before him and mocked him saying Hail King of the Jews!,0
24160,They spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head,0
24161,When they had mocked him they took the robe off of him and put his clothes on him and led him away to crucify him,0
24162,As they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name and they compelled him to go with them that he might carry his cross,0
24163,They came to a place called Golgotha that is to say The place of a skull,0
24164,They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall When he had tasted it he would not drink,0
24165,When they had crucified him they divided his clothing among them casting lotsTR adds that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet They divided my garments among them and for my clothing they cast lots [see Psalm 2218 and John 1924],0
24166,and they sat and watched him there,0
24167,They set up over his head the accusation against him written THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS,0
24168,Then there were two robbers crucified with him one on his right hand and one on the left,0
24169,Those who passed by blasphemed him wagging their heads,0
24170,and saying You who destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself! If you are the Son of God come down from the cross!,0
24171,Likewise the chief priests also mocking with the scribes the PhariseesTR omits the Pharisees and the elders said,0
24172,He saved others but he cant save himself If he is the King of Israel let him come down from the cross now and we will believe in him,0
24173,He trusts in God Let God deliver him now if he wants him for he said I am the Son of God,0
24174,The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach,0
24175,Now from the sixth hournoon there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour300 P M,0
24176,About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli limaTR reads lama instead of lima sabachthani That is My God my God why have you forsaken me,0
24177,Some of them who stood there when they heard it said This man is calling Elijah,0
24178,Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him a drink,0
24179,The rest said Let him be Lets see whether Elijah comes to save him,0
24180,Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit,0
24181,Behold the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom The earth quaked and the rocks were split,0
24182,The tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,0
24183,and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared to many,0
24184,Now the centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus when they saw the earthquake and the things that were done feared exceedingly saying Truly this was the Son of God,0
24185,Many women were there watching from afar who had followed Jesus from Galilee serving him,0
24186,Among them were Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee,0
24187,When evening had come a rich man from Arimathaea named Joseph who himself was also Jesus disciple came,0
24188,This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus body Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up,0
24189,Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,0
24190,and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed,0
24191,Mary Magdalene was there and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb,0
24192,Now on the next day which was the day after the Preparation Day the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,0
24193,saying Sir we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive After three days I will rise again,0
24194,Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away and tell the people He is risen from the dead and the last deception will be worse than the first,0
24195,Pilate said to them You have a guard Go make it as secure as you can,0
24196,So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure sealing the stone,0
24197,Now after the Sabbath as it began to dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb,0
24198,Behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it,0
24199,His appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow,0
24200,For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men,0
24201,The angel answered the women Dont be afraid for I know that you seek Jesus who has been crucified,0
24202,He is not here for he has risen just like he said Come see the place where the Lord was lying,0
24203,Go quickly and tell his disciples He has risen from the dead and behold he goes before you into Galilee there you will see him Behold I have told you,0
24204,They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to bring his disciples word,0
24205,As they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying Rejoice! They came and took hold of his feet and worshiped him,0
24206,Then Jesus said to them Dont be afraid Go tell my brothersThe word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings that they should go into Galilee and there they will see me,0
24207,Now while they were going behold some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened,0
24208,When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,0
24209,saying Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept,0
24210,If this comes to the governors ears we will persuade him and make you free of worry,0
24211,So they took the money and did as they were told This saying was spread abroad among the Jews and continues until this day,0
24212,But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had sent them,0
24213,When they saw him they bowed down to him but some doubted,0
24214,Jesus came to them and spoke to them saying All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth,0
24215,Therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,0
24216,teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you Behold I am with you always even to the end of the age Amen,0
24217,The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God,1
24218,As it is written in the prophets Behold I send my messenger before your face Who will prepare your way before you,1
24219,The voice of one crying in the wilderness Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!,1
24220,John came baptizingTo baptize means to immerse in or wash with water or fire This baptizm is not just to cleanse the body but as an outward sign of an inward spiritual cleansing and commitment in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,1
24221,All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him They were baptized by him in the Jordan river confessing their sins,1
24222,John was clothed with camels hair and a leather belt around his loins He ate locusts and wild honey,1
24223,He preached saying After me comes he who is mightier than I the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen,1
24224,I baptized you inThe Greek word en translated here as in could also be translated as with in some contexts water but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit,1
24225,It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan,1
24226,Immediately coming up from the water he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove,1
24227,A voice came out of the sky You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,1
24228,Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness,1
24229,He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan He was with the wild animals and the angels were ministering to him,1
24230,Now after John was taken into custody Jesus came into Galilee preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God,1
24231,and saying The time is fulfilled and the Kingdom of God is at hand! Repent and believe in the Gospel,1
24232,Passing along by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea for they were fishermen,1
24233,Jesus said to them Come after me and I will make you into fishers for men,1
24234,Immediately they left their nets and followed him,1
24235,Going on a little further from there he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother who were also in the boat mending the nets,1
24236,Immediately he called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after him,1
24237,They went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught,1
24238,They were astonished at his teaching for he taught them as having authority and not as the scribes,1
24239,Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out,1
24240,saying Ha! What do we have to do with you Jesus you Nazarene Have you come to destroy us I know you who you are the Holy One of God!,1
24241,Jesus rebuked him saying Be quiet and come out of him!,1
24242,The unclean spirit convulsing him and crying with a loud voice came out of him,1
24243,They were all amazed so that they questioned among themselves saying What is this A new teaching For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him!,1
24244,The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area,1
24245,Immediately when they had come out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John,1
24246,Now Simons wifes mother lay sick with a fever and immediately they told him about her,1
24247,He came and took her by the hand and raised her up The fever left her and she served them,1
24248,At evening when the sun had set they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons,1
24249,All the city was gathered together at the door,1
24250,He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons He didnt allow the demons to speak because they knew him,1
24251,Early in the night he rose up and went out and departed into a deserted place and prayed there,1
24252,Simon and those who were with him followed after him,1
24253,and they found him and told him Everyone is looking for you,1
24254,He said to them Lets go elsewhere into the next towns that I may preach there also because for this reason I came forth,1
24255,He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee preaching and casting out demons,1
24256,There came to him a leper begging him kneeling down to him and saying to him If you want to you can make me clean,1
24257,Being moved with compassion he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him I want to Be made clean,1
24258,When he had said this immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean,1
24259,He strictly warned him and immediately sent him out,1
24260,and said to him See you say nothing to anybody but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded for a testimony to them,1
24261,But he went out and began to proclaim it much and to spread about the matter so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city but was outside in desert places and they came to him from everywhere,1
24262,When he entered again into Capernaum after some days it was heard that he was in the house,1
24263,Immediately many were gathered together so that there was no more room not even around the door and he spoke the word to them,1
24264,Four people came carrying a paralytic to him,1
24265,When they could not come near to him for the crowd they removed the roof where he was When they had broken it up they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on,1
24266,Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic Son your sins are forgiven you,1
24267,But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,1
24268,Why does this man speak blasphemies like that Who can forgive sins but God alone,1
24269,Immediately Jesus perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves said to them Why do you reason these things in your hearts,1
24270,Which is easier to tell the paralytic Your sins are forgiven or to say Arise and take up your bed and walk,1
24271,But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralytic,1
24272,I tell you arise take up your mat and go to your house,1
24273,He arose and immediately took up the mat and went out in front of them all so that they were all amazed and glorified God saying We never saw anything like this!,1
24274,He went out again by the seaside All the multitude came to him and he taught them,1
24275,As he passed by he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office and he said to him Follow me And he arose and followed him,1
24276,It happened that he was reclining at the table in his house and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him,1
24277,The scribes and the Pharisees when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors said to his disciples Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners,1
24278,When Jesus heard it he said to them Those who are healthy have no need for a physician but those who are sick I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance,1
24279,Johns disciples and the Pharisees were fasting and they came and asked him Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast but your disciples dont fast,1
24280,Jesus said to them Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cant fast,1
24281,But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then will they fast in that day,1
24282,No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old and a worse hole is made,1
24283,No one puts new wine into old wineskins or else the new wine will burst the skins and the wine pours out and the skins will be destroyed but they put new wine into fresh wineskins,1
24284,It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of grain,1
24285,The Pharisees said to him Behold why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day,1
24286,He said to them Did you never read what David did when he had need and was hungryhe and they who were with him,1
24287,How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the show bread which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests and gave also to those who were with him,1
24288,He said to them The Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath,1
24289,Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath,1
24290,He entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there who had his hand withered,1
24291,They watched him whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day that they might accuse him,1
24292,He said to the man who had his hand withered Stand up,1
24293,He said to them Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do harm To save a life or to kill But they were silent,1
24294,When he had looked around at them with anger being grieved at the hardening of their hearts he said to the man Stretch out your hand He stretched it out and his hand was restored as healthy as the other,1
24295,The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him how they might destroy him,1
24296,Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples and a great multitude followed him from Galilee from Judea,1
24297,from Jerusalem from Idumaea beyond the Jordan and those from around Tyre and Sidon A great multitude hearing what great things he did came to him,1
24298,He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd so that they wouldnt press on him,1
24299,For he had healed many so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him,1
24300,The unclean spirits whenever they saw him fell down before him and cried You are the Son of God!,1
24301,He sternly warned them that they should not make him known,1
24302,He went up into the mountain and called to himself those whom he wanted and they went to him,1
24303,He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach,1
24304,and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons,1
24305,Simon to whom he gave the name Peter,1
24306,James the son of Zebedee John the brother of James and he surnamed them Boanerges which means Sons of Thunder,1
24307,Andrew Philip Bartholomew Matthew Thomas James the son of Alphaeus Thaddaeus Simon the Zealot,1
24308,and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him He came into a house,1
24309,The multitude came together again so that they could not so much as eat bread,1
24310,When his friends heard it they went out to seize him for they said He is insane,1
24311,The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said He has Beelzebul and By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons,1
24312,He summoned them and said to them in parables How can Satan cast out Satan,1
24313,If a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand,1
24314,If a house is divided against itself that house cannot stand,1
24315,If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided he cant stand but has an end,1
24316,But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder unless he first binds the strong man and then he will plunder his house,1
24317,Most assuredly I tell you all of the children of mens sins will be forgiven them including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme,1
24318,but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin,1
24319, because they said He has an unclean spirit,1
24320,His mother and his brothers came and standing outside they sent to him calling him,1
24321,A multitude was sitting around him and they told him Behold your mother your brothers and your sistersTR omits your sisters are outside looking for you,1
24322,He answered them Who are my mother and my brothers,1
24323,Looking around at those who sat around him he said Behold my mother and my brothers!,1
24324,For whoever does the will of God the same is my brother and my sister and mother,1
24325,Again he began to teach by the seaside A great multitude was gathered to him so that he entered into a boat in the sea and sat down All the multitude were on the land by the sea,1
24326,He taught them many things in parables and told them in his teaching,1
24327,Listen! Behold the farmer went out to sow,1
24328,and it happened as he sowed some seed fell by the road and the birdsTR adds of the air came and devoured it,1
24329,Others fell on the rocky ground where it had little soil and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil,1
24330,When the sun had risen it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away,1
24331,Others fell among the thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit,1
24332,Others fell into the good ground and yielded fruit growing up and increasing Some brought forth thirty times some sixty times and some one hundred times as much,1
24333,He said Whoever has ears to hear let him hear,1
24334,When he was alone those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables,1
24335,He said to them To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God but to those who are outside all things are done in parables,1
24336,that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest perhaps they should turn again and their sins should be forgiven them,1
24337,He said to them Dont you understand this parable How will you understand all of the parables,1
24338,The farmer sows the word,1
24339,These are the ones by the road where the word is sown and when they have heard immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them,1
24340,These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with joy,1
24341,They have no root in themselves but are shortlived When oppression or persecution arises because of the word immediately they stumble,1
24342,Others are those who are sown among the thorns These are those who have heard the word,1
24343,and the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful,1
24344,These are those which were sown on the good ground such as hear the word and accept it and bear fruit some thirty times some sixty times and some one hundred times,1
24345,He said to them Is the lamp brought to be put under a basketLiterally a modion a dry measuring basket containing about a peck about 9 litres or under a bed Isnt it put on a lampstand,1
24346,For there is nothing hidden except that it should be made known neither was anything made secret but that it should come to light,1
24347,If any man has ears to hear let him hear,1
24348,He said to them Take heed what you hear With whatever measure you measure it will be measured to you and more will be given to you who hear,1
24349,For whoever has to him will more be given and he who doesnt have from him will be taken away even that which he has,1
24350,He said The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,1
24351,and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring up and grow he doesnt know how,1
24352,For the earth bears fruit first the blade then the ear then the full grain in the ear,1
24353,But when the fruit is ripe immediately he puts forth the sickle because the harvest has come,1
24354,He said How will we liken the Kingdom of God Or with what parable will we illustrate it,1
24355,Its like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,1
24356,yet when it is sown grows up and becomes greater than all the herbs and puts out great branches so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow,1
24357,With many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it,1
24358,Without a parable he didnt speak to them but privately to his own disciples he explained all things,1
24359,On that day when evening had come he said to them Lets go over to the other side,1
24360,Leaving the multitude they took him with them even as he was in the boat Other small boats were also with him,1
24361,There arose a great wind storm and the waves beat into the boat so much that the boat was already filled,1
24362,He himself was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they woke him up and told him Teacher dont you care that we are dying,1
24363,He awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea Peace! Be still! The wind ceased and there was a great calm,1
24364,He said to them Why are you so afraid How is it that you have no faith,1
24365,They were greatly afraid and said to one another Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him,1
24366,They came to the other side of the sea into the country of the Gadarenes,1
24367,When he had come out of the boat immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,1
24368,who had his dwelling in the tombs Nobody could bind him any more not even with chains,1
24369,because he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been torn apart by him and the fetters broken in pieces Nobody had the strength to tame him,1
24370,Always night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones,1
24371,When he saw Jesus from afar he ran and bowed down to him,1
24372,and crying out with a loud voice he said What have I to do with you Jesus you Son of the Most High God I adjure you by God dont torment me,1
24373,For he said to him Come out of the man you unclean spirit!,1
24374,He asked him What is your name He said to him My name is Legion for we are many,1
24375,He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country,1
24376,Now there was on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding,1
24377,All the demons begged him saying Send us into the pigs that we may enter into them,1
24378,At once Jesus gave them permission The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and they were drowned in the sea,1
24379,Those who fed them fled and told it in the city and in the country The people came to see what it was that had happened,1
24380,They came to Jesus and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting clothed and in his right mind even him who had the legion and they were afraid,1
24381,Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons and about the pigs,1
24382,They began to beg him to depart from their region,1
24383,As he was entering into the boat he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him,1
24384,He didnt allow him but said to him Go to your house to your friends and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you,1
24385,He went his way and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him and everyone marveled,1
24386,When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side a great multitude was gathered to him and he was by the sea,1
24387,Behold one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name came and seeing him he fell at his feet,1
24388,and begged him much saying My little daughter is at the point of death Please come and lay your hands on her that she may be made healthy and live,1
24389,He went with him and a great multitude followed him and they pressed upon him on all sides,1
24390,A certain woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years,1
24391,and had suffered many things by many physicians and had spent all that she had and was no better but rather grew worse,1
24392,having heard the things concerning Jesus came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes,1
24393,For she said If I just touch his clothes I will be made well,1
24394,Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction,1
24395,Immediately Jesus perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him turned around in the crowd and asked Who touched my clothes,1
24396,His disciples said to him You see the multitude pressing against you and you say Who touched me,1
24397,He looked around to see her who had done this thing,1
24398,But the woman fearing and trembling knowing what had been done to her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth,1
24399,He said to her Daughter your faith has made you well Go in peace and be cured of your disease,1
24400,While he was still speaking they came from the synagogue rulers house saying Your daughter is dead Why bother the Teacher any more,1
24401,But Jesus when he heard the message spoken immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue Dont be afraid only believe,1
24402,He allowed no one to follow him except Peter James and John the brother of James,1
24403,He came to the synagogue rulers house and he saw an uproar weeping and great wailing,1
24404,When he had entered in he said to them Why do you make an uproar and weep The child is not dead but is asleep,1
24405,They ridiculed him But he having put them all out took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was lying,1
24406,Taking the child by the hand he said to her Talitha cumi which means being interpreted Girl I tell you get up,1
24407,Immediately the girl rose up and walked for she was twelve years old They were amazed with great amazement,1
24408,He strictly ordered them that no one should know this and commanded that something should be given to her to eat,1
24409,He went out from there He came into his own country and his disciples followed him,1
24410,When the Sabbath had come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying Where did this man get these things and What is the wisdom that is given to this man that such mighty works come about by his hands,1
24411,Isnt this the carpenter the son of Mary and brother of James Joses Judas and Simon Arent his sisters here with us They were offended at him,1
24412,Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own relatives and in his own house,1
24413,He could do no mighty work there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them,1
24414,He marveled because of their unbelief He went around the villages teaching,1
24415,He called to himself the twelve and began to send them out two by two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits,1
24416,He charged them that they should take nothing for their journey except a staff only no bread no wallet no money in their purse,1
24417,but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics,1
24418,He said to them Wherever you enter into a house stay there until you depart from there,1
24419,Whoever will not receive you nor hear you as you depart from there shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them Assuredly I tell you it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!,1
24420,They went out and preached that people should repent,1
24421,They cast out many demons and anointed many with oil who were sick and healed them,1
24422,King Herod heard this for his name had become known and he said John the Baptizer has risen from the dead and therefore these powers are at work in him,1
24423,But others said It is Elijah Others said It is the Prophet or like one of the prophets,1
24424,But Herod when he heard this said This is John whom I beheaded He has risen from the dead,1
24425,For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias his brother Philips wife for he had married her,1
24426,For John said to Herod It is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife,1
24427,Herodias set herself against him and desired to kill him but she couldnt,1
24428,for Herod feared John knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and kept him safe When he heard him he did many things and he heard him gladly,1
24429,Then a convenient day came that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles the high officers and the chief men of Galilee,1
24430,When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced she pleased Herod and those sitting with him The king said to the young lady Ask me whatever you want and I will give it to you,1
24431,He swore to her Whatever you shall ask of me I will give you up to half of my kingdom,1
24432,She went out and said to her mother What shall I ask She said The head of John the Baptizer,1
24433,She came in immediately with haste to the king and asked I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter,1
24434,The king was exceedingly sorry but for the sake of his oaths and of his dinner guests he didnt wish to refuse her,1
24435,Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring Johns head and he went and beheaded him in the prison,1
24436,and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the young lady and the young lady gave it to her mother,1
24437,When his disciples heard this they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb,1
24438,The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus and they told him all things whatever they had done and whatever they had taught,1
24439,He said to them You come apart into a deserted place and rest awhile For there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat,1
24440,They went away in the boat to a desert place by themselves,1
24441,TheyTR reads The multitudes instead of They saw them going and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities They arrived before them and came together to him,1
24442,Jesus came out saw a great multitude and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd and he began to teach them many things,1
24443,When it was late in the day his disciples came to him and said This place is deserted and it is late in the day,1
24444,Send them away that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat,1
24445,But he answered them You give them something to eat They asked him Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii200 denarii was about 7 or 8 months wages for an agricultural laborer worth of bread and give them something to eat,1
24446,He said to them How many loaves do you have Go see When they knew they said Five and two fish,1
24447,He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass,1
24448,They sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties,1
24449,He took the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he blessed and broke the loaves and he gave to his disciples to set before them and he divided the two fish among them all,1
24450,They all ate and were filled,1
24451,They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish,1
24452,Those who ate the loaves wereTR adds about five thousand men,1
24453,Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and to go ahead to the other side to Bethsaida while he himself sent the multitude away,1
24454,After he had taken leave of them he went up the mountain to pray,1
24455,When evening had come the boat was in the midst of the sea and he was alone on the land,1
24456,Seeing them distressed in rowing for the wind was contrary to them about the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea and he would have passed by them,1
24457,but they when they saw him walking on the sea supposed that it was a ghost and cried out,1
24458,for they all saw him and were troubled But he immediately spoke with them and said to them Cheer up! It is I!Literally I AM! Dont be afraid,1
24459,He got into the boat with them and the wind ceased and they were very amazed among themselves and marveled,1
24460,for they hadnt understood about the loaves but their hearts were hardened,1
24461,When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore,1
24462,When they had come out of the boat immediately the people recognized him,1
24463,and ran around that whole region and began to bring those who were sick on their mats to where they heard he was,1
24464,Wherever he entered into villages or into cities or into the country they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment and as many as touched him were made well,1
24465,Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him having come from Jerusalem,1
24466,Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled that is unwashed hands they found fault,1
24467,For the Pharisees and all the Jews dont eat unless they wash their hands and forearms holding to the tradition of the elders,1
24468,They dont eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves and there are many other things which they have received to hold to washings of cups pitchers bronze vessels and couches,1
24469,The Pharisees and the scribes asked him Why dont your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders but eat their bread with unwashed hands,1
24470,He answered them Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written This people honors me with their lips But their heart is far from me,1
24471,But in vain do they worship me Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men,1
24472,For you set aside the commandment of God and hold tightly to the tradition of menthe washing of pitchers and cups and you do many other such things,1
24473,He said to them Full well do you reject the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition,1
24474,For Moses said Honor your father and your mother and He who speaks evil of father or mother let him be put to death,1
24475,But you say If a man tells his father or his mother Whatever profit you might have received from me is CorbanCorban is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God that is to say given to God,1
24476,then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,1
24477,making void the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down You do many things like this,1
24478,He called all the multitude to himself and said to them Hear me all of you and understand,1
24479,There is nothing from outside of the man that going into him can defile him but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man,1
24480,If anyone has ears to hear let him hear!,1
24481,When he had entered into a house away from the multitude his disciples asked him about the parable,1
24482,He said to them Are you thus without understanding also Dont you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside cant defile him,1
24483,because it doesnt go into his heart but into his stomach then into the latrine thus making all foods clean,1
24484,He said That which proceeds out of the man that defiles the man,1
24485,For from within out of the hearts of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries sexual sins murders thefts,1
24486,covetings wickedness deceit lustful desires an evil eye blasphemy pride and foolishness,1
24487,All these evil things come from within and defile the man,1
24488,From there he arose and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon He entered into a house and didnt want anyone to know it but he couldnt escape notice,1
24489,For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit having heard of him came and fell down at his feet,1
24490,Now the woman was a Greek a Syrophoenician by race She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter,1
24491,But Jesus said to her Let the children be filled first for it is not appropriate to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs,1
24492,But she answered him Yes Lord Yet even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs,1
24493,He said to her For this saying go your way The demon has gone out of your daughter,1
24494,She went away to her house and found the child having been laid on the bed with the demon gone out,1
24495,Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon and came to the sea of Galilee through the midst of the region of Decapolis,1
24496,They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech They begged him to lay his hand on him,1
24497,He took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears and he spat and touched his tongue,1
24498,Looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him Ephphatha! that is Be opened!,1
24499,Immediately his ears were opened and the impediment of his tongue was released and he spoke clearly,1
24500,He commanded them that they should tell no one but the more he commanded them so much the more widely they proclaimed it,1
24501,They were astonished beyond measure saying He has done all things well He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!,1
24502,In those days when there was a very great multitude and they had nothing to eat Jesus called his disciples to himself and said to them,1
24503,I have compassion on the multitude because they have stayed with me now three days and have nothing to eat,1
24504,If I send them away fasting to their home they will faint on the way for some of them have come a long way,1
24505,His disciples answered him From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place,1
24506,He asked them How many loaves do you have They said Seven,1
24507,He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves Having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to serve and they served the multitude,1
24508,They had a few small fish Having blessed them he said to serve these also,1
24509,They ate and were filled They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over,1
24510,Those who had eaten were about four thousand Then he sent them away,1
24511,Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha,1
24512,The Pharisees came out and began to question him seeking from him a sign from heaven and testing him,1
24513,He sighed deeply in his spirit and said Why does this generationThe word translated generation here genea could also be translated people race or family seek a sign Most assuredly I tell you no sign will be given to this generation,1
24514,He left them and again entering into the boat departed to the other side,1
24515,They forgot to take bread and they didnt have more than one loaf in the boat with them,1
24516,He charged them saying Take heed beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod,1
24517,They reasoned with one another saying Its because we have no bread,1
24518,Jesus perceiving it said to them Why do you reason that its because you have no bread Dont you perceive yet neither understand Is your heart still hardened,1
24519,Having eyes dont you see Having ears dont you hear Dont you remember,1
24520,When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up They told him Twelve,1
24521,When the seven loaves fed the four thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up They told him Seven,1
24522,He asked them Dont you understand yet,1
24523,He came to Bethsaida They brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him,1
24524,He took hold of the blind man by the hand and brought him out of the village When he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him he asked him if he saw anything,1
24525,He looked up and said I see men for I see them like trees walking,1
24526,Then again he laid his hands on his eyes He looked intently and was restored and saw everyone clearly,1
24527,He sent him away to his house saying Dont enter into the village nor tell anyone in the village,1
24528,Jesus went out with his disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi On the way he asked his disciples Who do men say that I am,1
24529,They told him John the Baptizer and others say Elijah but others one of the prophets,1
24530,He said to them But who do you say that I am Peter answered You are the Christ,1
24531,He charged them that they should tell no one about him,1
24532,He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again,1
24533,He spoke to them openly Peter took him and began to rebuke him,1
24534,But he turning around and seeing his disciples rebuked Peter and said Get behind me Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God but the things of men,1
24535,He called the multitude to himself with his disciples and said to them Whoever wants to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me,1
24536,For whoever wants to save his life will lose it and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the Gospels will save it,1
24537,For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life,1
24538,For what will a man give in exchange for his life,1
24539,For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels,1
24540,He said to them Most assuredly I tell you there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power,1
24541,After six days Jesus took with him Peter James and John and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves and he was changed into another form in front of them,1
24542,His clothing became glistening exceedingly white like snow such as no launderer on earth can whiten them,1
24543,Elijah and Moses appeared to them and they were talking with Jesus,1
24544,Peter answered Jesus Rabbi it is good for us to be here Lets make three tents one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah,1
24545,For he didnt know what to say for they were very afraid,1
24546,A cloud came overshadowing them and a voice came out of the cloud This is my beloved Son Listen to him,1
24547,Suddenly looking around they saw no one with them any more except Jesus only,1
24548,As they were coming down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no one what things they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead,1
24549,They kept this saying to themselves questioning what the rising from the dead meant,1
24550,They asked him saying Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first,1
24551,He said to them Elijah indeed comes first and restores all things How is it written about the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be despised,1
24552,But I tell you that Elijah has come and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to even as it is written about him,1
24553,Coming to the disciples he saw a great multitude around them and scribes questioning them,1
24554,Immediately all the multitude when they saw him were greatly amazed and running to him greeted him,1
24555,He asked the scribes What are you asking them,1
24556,One of the multitude answered Teacher I brought to you my son who has a mute spirit,1
24557,and wherever it seizes him it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and wastes away I asked your disciples to cast it out and they werent able,1
24558,He answered him Unbelieving generation how long shall I be with you How long shall I bear with you Bring him to me,1
24559,They brought him to him and when he saw him immediately the spirit convulsed him and he fell on the ground wallowing and foaming at the mouth,1
24560,He asked his father How long has it been since this has come to him He said From childhood,1
24561,Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him But if you can do anything have compassion on us and help us,1
24562,Jesus said to him If you can believe all things are possible to him who believes,1
24563,Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears I believe Help my unbelief!,1
24564,When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together he rebuked the unclean spirit saying to him You mute and deaf spirit I command you come out of him and never enter him again!,1
24565,Having cried out and convulsed greatly it came out of him The boy became like one dead so much that most of them said He is dead,1
24566,But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up and he arose,1
24567,When he had come into the house his disciples asked him privately Why couldnt we cast it out,1
24568,He said to them This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer and fasting,1
24569,They went out from there and passed through Galilee He didnt want anyone to know it,1
24570,For he was teaching his disciples and said to them The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men and they will kill him and when he is killed on the third day he will rise again,1
24571,But they didnt understand the saying and were afraid to ask him,1
24572,He came to Capernaum and when he was in the house he asked them What were you arguing among yourselves on the way,1
24573,But they were silent for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest,1
24574,He sat down and called the twelve and he said to them If any man wants to be first he shall be last of all and servant of all,1
24575,He took a little child and set him in the midst of them Taking him in his arms he said to them,1
24576,Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me and whoever receives me doesnt receive me but him who sent me,1
24577,John said to him Teacher we saw someone who doesnt follow us casting out demons in your name and we forbade him because he doesnt follow us,1
24578,But Jesus said Dont forbid him for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name and be able quickly to speak evil of me,1
24579,For whoever is not against us is on our side,1
24580,For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christs most assuredly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward,1
24581,Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble it would be better for him if he was thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck,1
24582,If your hand causes you to stumble cut it off It is better for you to enter into life maimed rather than having your two hands to go into GehennaGehenna is a word for Hell that originated as the name for a place where live babies were thrown crying into the fire under the arms of the idol Moloch to die This place was so despised by the people after the righteous King Josiah abolished this hideous practice that not only was it made into a garbage heap but dead bodies of diseased animals and executed criminals were thrown there and burned into the unquenchable fire,1
24583,where their worm doesnt die and the fire is not quenched,1
24584,If your foot causes you to stumble cut it off It is better for you to enter into life lame rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna into the fire that will never be quenched,1
24585,where their worm doesnt die and the fire is not quenched,1
24586,If your eye causes you to stumble cast it out It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire,1
24587,where their worm doesnt die and the fire is not quenched,1
24588,For everyone will be salted with fire and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt,1
24589,Salt is good but if the salt has lost its saltiness with what will you season it Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another,1
24590,He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan Multitudes came together to him again As he usually did he was again teaching them,1
24591,Pharisees came to him testing him and asked him Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife,1
24592,He answered What did Moses command you,1
24593,They said Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written and to divorce her,1
24594,But Jesus said to them For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment,1
24595,But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female,1
24596,For this cause a man will leave his father and mother and will join to his wife,1
24597,and the two will become one flesh so that they are no longer two but one flesh,1
24598,What therefore God has joined together let no man separate,1
24599,In the house his disciples asked him again about the same matter,1
24600,He said to them Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her,1
24601,If a woman herself divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery,1
24602,They were bringing to him little children that he should touch them but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them,1
24603,But when Jesus saw it he was moved with indignation and said to them Allow the little children to come to me! Dont forbid them for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these,1
24604,Most assuredly I tell you whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child he will in no way enter into it,1
24605,He took them in his arms and blessed them laying his hands on them,1
24606,As he was going out into the way one ran to him knelt before him and asked him Good Teacher what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life,1
24607,Jesus said to him Why do you call me good No one is good except one God,1
24608,You know the commandments Do not murder Do not commit adultery Do not steal Do not give false testimony Do not defraud Honor your father and mother,1
24609,He said to him Teacher I have observed all these things from my youth,1
24610,Jesus looking at him loved him and said to him One thing you lack Go sell whatever you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me taking up the cross,1
24611,But his face fell at that saying and he went away sorrowful for he was one who had great possessions,1
24612,Jesus looked around and said to his disciples How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!,1
24613,The disciples were amazed at his words But Jesus answered again Children how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!,1
24614,It is easier for a camel to go through aor the needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God,1
24615,They were exceedingly astonished saying to him Then who can be saved,1
24616,Jesus looking at them said With men it is impossible but not with God for all things are possible with God,1
24617,Peter began to tell him Behold we have left all and have followed you,1
24618,Jesus said Most assuredly I tell you there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or land for my sake and for the Gospels sake,1
24619,but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time houses brothers sisters mothers children and land with persecutions and in the age to come eternal life,1
24620,But many who are first will be last and the last first,1
24621,They were on the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus was going in front of them and they were amazed and those who followed were afraid He again took the twelve and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him,1
24622,Behold we are going up to Jerusalem The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes They will condemn him to death and will deliver him to the Gentiles,1
24623,They will mock him spit on him scourge him and kill him On the third day he will rise again,1
24624,James and John the sons of Zebedee came near to him saying Teacher we want you to do for us whatever we will ask,1
24625,He said to them What do you want me to do for you,1
24626,They said to him Grant to us that we may sit one at your right hand and one at your left hand in your glory,1
24627,But Jesus said to them You dont know what you are asking Are you able to drink the cup that I drink and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,1
24628,They said to him We are able Jesus said to them You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,1
24629,but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give but for whom it has been prepared,1
24630,When the ten heard it they began to be indignant towards James and John,1
24631,Jesus summoned them and said to them You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them,1
24632,But it shall not be so among you but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant,1
24633,Whoever of you wants to become first among you shall be bondservant of all,1
24634,For the Son of Man also came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many,1
24635,They came to Jericho As he went out from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude the son of Timaeus Bartimaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the road,1
24636,When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene he began to cry out and say Jesus you son of David have mercy on me!,1
24637,Many rebuked him that he should be quiet but he cried out much more You son of David have mercy on me!,1
24638,Jesus stood still and said Call him They called the blind man saying to him Cheer up! Get up He is calling you!,1
24639,He casting away his cloak sprang up and came to Jesus,1
24640,Jesus asked him What do you want me to do for you The blind man said to him RhabboniRhabboni is a transliteration of the Hebrew word for great teacher that I may see again,1
24641,Jesus said to him Go your way Your faith has made you well Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way,1
24642,When they drew near to Jerusalem to BethsphageTR reads Bethphage instead of Bethsphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples,1
24643,and said to them Go your way into the village that is opposite you Immediately as you enter into it you will find a young donkey tied on which no one has sat Untie him and bring him,1
24644,If anyone asks you Why are you doing this say The Lord needs him and immediately he will send him back here,1
24645,They went away and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street and they untied him,1
24646,Some of those who stood there asked them What are you doing untying the young donkey,1
24647,They said to them just as Jesus had said and they let them go,1
24648,They brought the young donkey to Jesus and threw their garments on it and Jesus sat on it,1
24649,Many spread their garments on the way and others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road,1
24650,Those who went in front and those who followed cried out Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!,1
24651,Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!,1
24652,Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem When he had looked around at everything it being now evening he went out to Bethany with the twelve,1
24653,The next day when they had come out from Bethany he was hungry,1
24654,Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it When he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs,1
24655,Jesus told it May no one ever eat fruit from you again! and his disciples heard it,1
24656,They came to Jerusalem and Jesus entered into the temple and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold the doves,1
24657,He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple,1
24658,He taught saying to them Isnt it written My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations But you have made it a den of robbers!,1
24659,The chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought how they might destroy him For they feared him because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching,1
24660,When evening came he went out of the city,1
24661,As they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots,1
24662,Peter remembering said to him Rabbi look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away,1
24663,Jesus answered them Have faith in God,1
24664,For most assuredly I tell you whoever may tell this mountain Be taken up and cast into the sea and doesnt doubt in his heart but believes that what he says is happening he shall have whatever he says,1
24665,Therefore I tell you all things whatever you pray and ask for believe that you receive them and you shall have them,1
24666,Whenever you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anyone so that your Father who is in heaven may also forgive you your transgressions,1
24667,But if you do not forgive neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions,1
24668,They came again to Jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him,1
24669,and they began saying to him By what authority do you do these things Or who gave you this authority to do these things,1
24670,Jesus said to them I will ask you one question Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things,1
24671,The baptism of John  was it from heaven or from men Answer me,1
24672,They reasoned with themselves saying If we should say From heaven he will say Why then did you not believe him,1
24673,If we should say From menthey feared the people for all held John to really be a prophet,1
24674,They answered Jesus We dont know Jesus said to them Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things,1
24675,He began to speak to them in parables A man planted a vineyard put a hedge around it dug a pit for the winepress built a tower rented it out to a farmer and went into another country,1
24676,When it was time he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard,1
24677,They took him beat him and sent him away empty,1
24678,Again he sent another servant to them and they threw stones at him wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully treated,1
24679,Again he sent another and they killed him and many others beating some and killing some,1
24680,Therefore still having one his beloved son he sent him last to them saying They will respect my son,1
24681,But those farmers said among themselves This is the heir Come lets kill him and the inheritance will be ours,1
24682,They took him killed him and cast him out of the vineyard,1
24683,What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do He will come and destroy the farmers and will give the vineyard to others,1
24684,Havent you even read this Scripture The stone which the builders rejected The same was made the head of the corner,1
24685,This was from the Lord It is marvelous in our eyes,1
24686,They tried to seize him but they feared the multitude for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them They left him and went away,1
24687,They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him that they might trap him with words,1
24688,When they had come they asked him Teacher we know that you are honest and dont defer to anyone for you arent partial to anyone but truly teach the way of God Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not,1
24689,Shall we give or shall we not give But he knowing their hypocrisy said to them Why do you test me Bring me a denarius that I may see it,1
24690,They brought it He said to them Whose is this image and inscription They said to him Caesars,1
24691,Jesus answered them Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are Gods They marveled greatly at him,1
24692,There came to him Sadducees who say that there is no resurrection They asked him saying,1
24693,Teacher Moses wrote to us If a mans brother dies and leaves a wife behind him and leaves no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother,1
24694,There were seven brothers The first took a wife and dying left no offspring,1
24695,The second took her and died leaving no children behind him The third likewise,1
24696,and the seven took her and left no children Last of all the woman also died,1
24697,In the resurrection when they rise whose wife will she be of them For the seven had her as a wife,1
24698,Jesus answered them Isnt this because you are mistaken not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God,1
24699,For when they will rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven,1
24700,But about the dead that they are raised havent you read in the book of Moses about the Bush how God spoke to him saying I am the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,1
24701,He is not the God of the dead but of the living You are therefore badly mistaken,1
24702,One of the scribes came and heard them questioning together Knowing that he had answered them well asked him Which commandment is the greatest of all,1
24703,Jesus answered The greatest is Hear Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one,1
24704,you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength This is the first commandment,1
24705,The second is like this You shall love your neighbor as yourself There is no other commandment greater than these,1
24706,The scribe said to him Truly teacher you have said well that he is one and there is none other but he,1
24707,and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices,1
24708,When Jesus saw that he answered wisely he said to him You are not far from the Kingdom of God No one dared ask him any question after that,1
24709,Jesus responded as he taught in the temple How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David,1
24710,For David himself said in the Holy Spirit The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet,1
24711,Therefore David himself calls him Lord so how can he be his son The common people heard him gladly,1
24712,In his teaching he said to them Beware of the scribes who like to walk in long robes and to get greetings in the marketplaces,1
24713,and the best seats in the synagogues and the best places at feasts,1
24714,those who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers These will receive greater condemnation,1
24715,Jesus sat down opposite the treasury and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury Many who were rich cast in much,1
24716,A poor widow came and she cast in two small brass coinsLiterally lepta or widows mites Lepta are very small brass coins worth half a quadrans each which is a quarter of the copper assarion Lepta are worth less than 1 of an agricultural workers daily wages which equal a quadrans coinA quadrans is a coin worth about 164 of a denarius A denarius is about one days wages for an agricultural laborer,1
24717,He called his disciples to himself and said to them Most assuredly I tell you this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,1
24718,for they all gave out of their abundance but she out of her poverty gave all that she had to live on,1
24719,As he went out of the temple one of his disciples said to him Teacher see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!,1
24720,Jesus said to him Do you see these great buildings There will not be left here one stone on another which will not be thrown down,1
24721,As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple Peter James John and Andrew asked him privately,1
24722,Tell us when will these things be What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled,1
24723,Jesus answering began to tell them Be careful that no one leads you astray,1
24724,For many will come in my name saying I am he!Literally I AM! and will lead many astray,1
24725,When you hear of wars and rumors of wars dont be troubled For those must happen but the end is not yet,1
24726,For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom There will be earthquakes in various places There will be famines and troubles These things are the beginning of birth pains,1
24727,But watch yourselves for they will deliver you up to councils You will be beaten in synagogues You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony to them,1
24728,The Gospel must first be preached to all the nations,1
24729,When they lead you away and deliver you up dont be anxious beforehand or premeditate what you will say but say whatever will be given you in that hour For it is not you who speak but the Holy Spirit,1
24730,Brother will deliver up brother to death and the father his child Children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death,1
24731,You will be hated by all men for my names sake but he who endures to the end the same will be saved,1
24732,But when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let the reader understand then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,1
24733,and let him who is on the housetop not go down nor enter in to take anything out of his house,1
24734,Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak,1
24735,But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!,1
24736,Pray that your flight wont be in the winter,1
24737,For in those days there will be oppression such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now and never will be,1
24738,Unless the Lord had shortened the days no flesh would have been saved but for the sake of the chosen ones whom he picked out he shortened the days,1
24739,Then if anyone tells you Look here is the Christ! or Look there! dont believe it,1
24740,For there will arise false christs and false prophets and will show signs and wonders that they may lead astray if possible even the chosen ones,1
24741,But you watch Behold I have told you all things beforehand,1
24742,But in those days after that oppression the sun will be darkened the moon will not give its light,1
24743,the stars will be falling from the sky and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken,1
24744,Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory,1
24745,Then he will send out his angels and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky,1
24746,Now from the fig tree learn this parable When the branch has now become tender and puts forth its leaves you know that the summer is near,1
24747,even so you also when you see these things coming to pass know that it is near at the doors,1
24748,Most assuredly I say to you this generationThe word translated generation genea could also be translated race family or people will not pass away until all these things happen,1
24749,Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away,1
24750,But of that day or that hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but only the Father,1
24751,Watch keep alert and pray for you dont know when the time is,1
24752,It is like a man traveling to another country having left his house and given authority to his servants and to each one his work and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch,1
24753,Watch therefore for you dont know when the lord of the house is coming whether at evening or at midnight or when the rooster crows or in the morning,1
24754,lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping,1
24755,What I tell you I tell all Watch,1
24756,It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might sieze him by deception and kill him,1
24757,For they said Not during the feast because there might be a riot of the people,1
24758,While he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he sat at the table a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard very costly She broke the jar and poured it over his head,1
24759,But there were some who were indignant among themselves saying Why has this ointment been wasted,1
24760,For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii300 denarii was about a years wages for an agricultural laborer and given to the poor They grumbled against her,1
24761,But Jesus said Leave her alone Why do you trouble her She has done a good work for me,1
24762,For you always have the poor with you and whenever you want to you can do them good but you will not always have me,1
24763,She has done what she could She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying,1
24764,Most assuredly I tell you wherever this Gospel may be preached throughout the whole world that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her,1
24765,Judas Iscariot who was one of the twelve went away to the chief priests that he might deliver him to them,1
24766,They when they heard it were glad and promised to give him money He sought how he might conveniently deliver him,1
24767,On the first day of unleavened bread when they sacrificed the Passover his disciples asked him Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover,1
24768,He sent two of his disciples and said to them Go into the city and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water Follow him,1
24769,and wherever he enters in tell the master of the house The Teacher says Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples,1
24770,He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready Make ready for us there,1
24771,His disciples went out and came into the city and found things as he had said to them and they prepared the Passover,1
24772,When it was evening he came with the twelve,1
24773,As they sat and were eating Jesus said Most assuredly I tell you one of you will betray me  he who eats with me,1
24774,They began to be sorrowful and to ask him one by one Surely not I And another said Surely not I,1
24775,He answered them It is one of the twelve he who dips with me in the dish,1
24776,For the Son of Man goes even as it is written about him but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born,1
24777,As they were eating Jesus took bread and when he had blessed he broke it and gave to them and said Take eat This is my body,1
24778,He took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave to them They all drank of it,1
24779,He said to them This is my blood of the new covenant which is poured out for many,1
24780,Most assuredly I tell you I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God,1
24781,When they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives,1
24782,Jesus said to them All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered,1
24783,However after I am raised up I will go before you into Galilee,1
24784,But Peter said to him Although all will be offended yet I will not,1
24785,Jesus said to him Most assuredly I tell you that you today even this night before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times,1
24786,But he spoke all the more If I must die with you I will not deny you They all said the same thing,1
24787,They came to a place which was named Gethsemane He said to his disciples Sit here while I pray,1
24788,He took with him Peter James and John and began to be greatly troubled and distressed,1
24789,He said to them My soul is exceedingly sorrowful even to death Stay here and watch,1
24790,He went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass away from him,1
24791,He said Abba Father all things are possible to you Please remove this cup from me However not what I desire but what you desire,1
24792,He came and found them sleeping and said to Peter Simon are you sleeping Couldnt you watch one hour,1
24793,Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,1
24794,Again he went away and prayed saying the same words,1
24795,Again he returned and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they didnt know what to answer him,1
24796,He came the third time and said to them Sleep on now and take your rest It is enough The hour has come Behold the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners,1
24797,Arise let us be going Behold he who betrays me is at hand,1
24798,Immediately while he was still speaking Judas one of the twelve cameand with him a multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests the scribes and the elders,1
24799,Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign saying Whoever I will kiss that is he Seize him and lead him away safely,1
24800,When he had come immediately he came to him and said Rabbi! Rabbi! and kissed him,1
24801,They laid their hands on him and seized him,1
24802,But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear,1
24803,Jesus answered them Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me,1
24804,I was daily with you in the temple teaching and you didnt arrest me But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled,1
24805,They all left him and fled,1
24806,A certain young man followed him having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body The young men grabbed him,1
24807,but he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked,1
24808,They led Jesus away to the high priest All the chief priests the elders and the scribes came together with him,1
24809,Peter had followed him from a distance until he came into the court of the high priest He was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light of the fire,1
24810,Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death and found none,1
24811,For many gave false testimony against him and their testimony didnt agree with each other,1
24812,Some stood up and gave false testimony against him saying,1
24813,We heard him say I will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days I will build another made without hands,1
24814,Even so their testimony did not agree,1
24815,The high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus Have you no answer What is it which these testify against you,1
24816,But he stayed quiet and answered nothing Again the high priest asked him Are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed,1
24817,Jesus said I AM You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of the sky,1
24818,The high priest tore his clothes and said What further need have we of witnesses,1
24819,You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think They all condemned him to be worthy of death,1
24820,Some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to beat him with fists and to tell him Prophesy! The officers struck him with the palms of their hands,1
24821,As Peter was in the courtyard below one of the maids of the high priest came,1
24822,and seeing Peter warming himself she looked at him and said You were also with the Nazarene Jesus!,1
24823,But he denied it saying I neither know nor understand what you are saying He went out on the porch and the rooster crowed,1
24824,The maid saw him and began again to tell those who stood by This is one of them,1
24825,But he again denied it After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter You truly are one of them for you are a Galilean and your speech shows it,1
24826,But he began to curse and to swear I dont know this man of whom you speak!,1
24827,The rooster crowed the second time Peter remembered the word how that Jesus said to him Before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times When he thought about that he wept,1
24828,Immediately in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole council held a consultation and bound Jesus and carried him away and delivered him up to Pilate,1
24829,Pilate asked him Are you the King of the Jews He answered So you say,1
24830,The chief priests accused him of many things,1
24831,Pilate again asked him Have you no answer See how many things they testify against you!,1
24832,But Jesus made no further answer so that Pilate marveled,1
24833,Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner whom they asked of him,1
24834,There was one called Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection men who in the insurrection had committed murder,1
24835,The multitude crying aloud began to ask him to do as he always did for them,1
24836,Pilate answered them saying Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews,1
24837,For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up,1
24838,But the chief priests stirred up the multitude that he should release Barabbas to them instead,1
24839,Pilate again asked them What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews,1
24840,They cried out again Crucify him!,1
24841,Pilate said to them Why what evil has he done But they cried out exceedingly Crucify him!,1
24842,Pilate wishing to please the multitude released Barabbas to them and handed over Jesus when he had flogged him to be crucified,1
24843,The soldiers led him away within the court which is the Praetorium and they called together the whole cohort,1
24844,They clothed him with purple and weaving a crown of thorns they put it on him,1
24845,They began to salute him Hail King of the Jews!,1
24846,They struck his head with a reed and spat on him and bowing their knees did homage to him,1
24847,When they had mocked him they took the purple off of him and put his own garments on him They led him out to crucify him,1
24848,They compelled one passing by coming from the country Simon of Cyrene the father of Alexander and Rufus to go with them that he might bear his cross,1
24849,They brought him to the place called Golgotha which is being interpreted The place of a skull,1
24850,They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink but he didnt take it,1
24851,Crucifying him they parted his garments among them casting lots on them what each should take,1
24852,It was the third hour900 A M and they crucified him,1
24853,The superscription of his accusation was written over him THE KING OF THE JEWS,1
24854,With him they crucified two robbers one on his right hand and one on his left,1
24855,The Scripture was fulfilled which says He was numbered with transgressors,1
24856,Those who passed by blasphemed him wagging their heads and saying Ha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,1
24857,save yourself and come down from the cross!,1
24858,Likewise also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said He saved others He cant save himself,1
24859,Let the Christ the King of Israel now come down from the cross that we may see and believe himTR omits him Those who were crucified with him insulted him,1
24860,When the sixth houror noon had come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour300 PM,1
24861,At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted My God my God why have you forsaken me,1
24862,Some of those who stood by when they heard it said Behold he is calling Elijah,1
24863,One ran and filling a sponge full of vinegar put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink saying Let him be Lets see whether Elijah comes to take him down,1
24864,Jesus cried out with a loud voice and gave up the spirit,1
24865,The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom,1
24866,When the centurion who stood by opposite him saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last he said Truly this man was the Son of God!,1
24867,There were also women watching from afar among whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses and Salome,1
24868,who when he was in Galilee followed him and served him and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem,1
24869,When evening had now come because it was the Preparation Day that is the day before the Sabbath,1
24870,Joseph of Arimathaea a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God came He boldly went in to Pilate and asked for Jesus body,1
24871,Pilate marveled if he were already dead and summoning the centurion he asked him whether he had been dead long,1
24872,When he found out from the centurion he granted the body to Joseph,1
24873,He bought a linen cloth and taking him down wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb,1
24874,Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid,1
24875,When the Sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices that they might come and anoint him,1
24876,Very early on the first day of the week they came to the tomb when the sun had risen,1
24877,They were saying among themselves Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us,1
24878,for it was very big Looking up they saw that the stone was rolled back,1
24879,Entering into the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side dressed in a white robe and they were amazed,1
24880,He said to them Dont be amazed You seek Jesus the Nazarene who has been crucified He has risen He is not here Behold the place where they laid him!,1
24881,But go tell his disciples and Peter He goes before you into Galilee There you will see him as he said to you,1
24882,They went outTR adds quickly and fled from the tomb for trembling and astonishment had come on them They said nothing to anyone for they were afraid,1
24883,Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons,1
24884,She went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept,1
24885,When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they disbelieved,1
24886,After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them as they walked on their way into the country,1
24887,They went away and told it to the rest They didnt believe them either,1
24888,Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they didnt believe those who had seen him after he had risen,1
24889,He said to them Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation,1
24890,He who believes and is baptized will be saved but he who disbelieves will be condemned,1
24891,These signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will cast out demons they will speak with new languages,1
24892,they will take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it will in no way hurt them they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover,1
24893,So then the Lord Jesus after he had spoken to them was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God,1
24894,They went out and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed Amen,1
24895,Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,2
24896,even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,2
24897,it seemed good to me also having traced the course of all things accurately from the first to write to you in order most excellent Theophilus,2
24898,that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed,2
24899,There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea a certain priest named Zacharias of the priestly division of Abijah He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth,2
24900,They were both righteous before God walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord,2
24901,But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren and they both were well advanced in years,2
24902,Now it happened while he executed the priests office before God in the order of his division,2
24903,according to the custom of the priests office his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense,2
24904,The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense,2
24905,An angel of the Lord appeared to him standing on the right side of the altar of incense,2
24906,Zacharias was troubled when he saw him and fear fell upon him,2
24907,But the angel said to him Dont be afraid Zacharias because your request has been heard and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you shall call his name John,2
24908,You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth,2
24909,For he will be great in the sight of the Lord and he will drink no wine nor strong drink He will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mothers womb,2
24910,He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,2
24911,He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord,2
24912,Zacharias said to the angel How can I be sure of this For I am an old man and my wife is well advanced in years,2
24913,The angel answered him I am Gabriel who stands in the presence of God I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news,2
24914,Behold you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things will happen because you didnt believe my words which will be fulfilled in their proper time,2
24915,The people were waiting for Zacharias and they marveled that he delayed in the temple,2
24916,When he came out he could not speak to them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple He continued making signs to them and remained mute,2
24917,It happened when the days of his service were fulfilled he departed to his house,2
24918,After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and she hid herself five months saying,2
24919,Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me to take away my reproach among men,2
24920,Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,2
24921,to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David The virgins name was Mary,2
24922,Having come in the angel said to her Rejoice you highly favored one! The Lord is with you Blessed are you among women!,2
24923,But when she saw him she was greatly troubled at the saying and considered what kind of salutation this might be,2
24924,The angel said to her Dont be afraid Mary for you have found favor with God,2
24925,Behold you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a son and will call his name Jesus,2
24926,He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,2
24927,and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever There will be no end to his Kingdom,2
24928,Mary said to the angel How can this be seeing I am a virgin,2
24929,The angel answered her The Holy Spirit will come on you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God,2
24930,Behold Elizabeth your relative also has conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren,2
24931,For everything spoken by God is possible,2
24932,Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it to me according to your word The angel departed from her,2
24933,Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of Judah,2
24934,and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth,2
24935,It happened when Elizabeth heard Marys greeting that the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,2
24936,She called out with a loud voice and said Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!,2
24937,Why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me,2
24938,For behold when the voice of your greeting came into my ears the baby leaped in my womb for joy!,2
24939,Blessed is she who believed for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!,2
24940,Mary said My soul magnifies the Lord,2
24941,My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,2
24942,For he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid For behold from now on all generations will call me blessed,2
24943,For he who is mighty has done great things for me Holy is his name,2
24944,His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him,2
24945,He has shown strength with his arm He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart,2
24946,He has put down princes from their thrones And has exalted the lowly,2
24947,He has filled the hungry with good things He has sent the rich away empty,2
24948,He has given help to Israel his servant that he might remember mercy,2
24949,As he spoke to our fathers To Abraham and his seed forever,2
24950,Mary stayed with her about three months and then returned to her house,2
24951,Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled and she brought forth a son,2
24952,Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her and they rejoiced with her,2
24953,It happened on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child and they would have called him Zacharias after the name of the father,2
24954,His mother answered Not so but he will be called John,2
24955,They said to her There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name,2
24956,They made signs to his father what he would have him called,2
24957,He asked for a writing tablet and wrote His name is John They all marveled,2
24958,His mouth was opened immediately and his tongue freed and he spoke blessing God,2
24959,Fear came on all who lived around them and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea,2
24960,All who heard them laid them up in their heart saying What then will this child be The hand of the Lord was with him,2
24961,His father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied saying,2
24962,Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel For he has visited and worked redemption for his people,2
24963,And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,2
24964,As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old,2
24965,Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,2
24966,To show mercy towards our fathers To remember his holy covenant,2
24967,The oath which he spoke to Abraham our father,2
24968,To grant to us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies should serve him without fear,2
24969,In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life,2
24970,And you child will be called a prophet of the Most High For you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways,2
24971,To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,2
24972,Because of the tender mercy of our God Whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,2
24973,To shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death To guide our feet into the way of peace,2
24974,The child was growing and becoming strong in spirit and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel,2
24975,Now it happened in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled,2
24976,This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria,2
24977,All went to enroll themselves everyone to his own city,2
24978,Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and family of David,2
24979,to enroll himself with Mary who was pledged to be married to him as wife being pregnant,2
24980,It happened while they were there that the day had come that she should give birth,2
24981,She brought forth her firstborn son and she wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough because there was no room for them in the inn,2
24982,There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field and keeping watch by night over their flock,2
24983,Behold an angel of the Lord stood by them and the glory of the Lord shone around them and they were terrified,2
24984,The angel said to them Dont be afraid for behold I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people,2
24985,For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior who is Christ the Lord,2
24986,This is the sign to you you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth lying in a feeding trough,2
24987,Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,2
24988,Glory to God in the highest On earth peace good will toward men,2
24989,It happened when the angels went away from them into the sky that the shepherds said one to another Lets go to Bethlehem now and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us,2
24990,They came with haste and found both Mary and Joseph and the baby was lying in the feeding trough,2
24991,When they saw it they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child,2
24992,All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds,2
24993,But Mary kept all these sayings pondering them in her heart,2
24994,The shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen just as it was told them,2
24995,When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child his name was called Jesus which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb,2
24996,When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,2
24997,as it is written in the law of the Lord Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord,2
24998,and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,2
24999,Behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon This man was righteous and devout looking for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was on him,2
25000,It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lords ChristChrist Greek and Messiah Hebrew both mean Anointed One,2
25001,He came in the Spirit into the temple When the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,2
25002,then he received him into his arms and blessed God and said,2
25003,Now you are releasing your servant Master According to your word in peace,2
25004,For my eyes have seen your salvation,2
25005,Which you have prepared before the face of all peoples,2
25006,A light for revelation to the Gentiles And the glory of your people Israel,2
25007,Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,2
25008,and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother Behold this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel and for a sign which is spoken against,2
25009,Yes a sword will pierce through your own soul that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed,2
25010,There was one Anna a prophetess the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher she was of a great age having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,2
25011,and she had been a widow for about eightyfour years who didnt depart from the temple worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day,2
25012,Coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to the Lord and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem,2
25013,When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth,2
25014,The child was growing and was becoming strong in spirit being filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him,2
25015,His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover,2
25016,When he was twelve years old they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,2
25017,and when they had fulfilled the days as they were returning the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem Joseph and his mother didnt know it,2
25018,but supposing him to be in the company they went a days journey and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances,2
25019,When they didnt find him they returned to Jerusalem looking for him,2
25020,It happened after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers both listening to them and asking them questions,2
25021,All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers,2
25022,When they saw him they were astonished and his mother said to him Son why have you treated us this way Behold your father and I were anxiously looking for you,2
25023,He said to them Why were you looking for me Didnt you know that I must be in my Fathers house,2
25024,They didnt understand the saying which he spoke to them,2
25025,And he went down with them and came to Nazareth He was subject to them and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart,2
25026,And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men,2
25027,Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,2
25028,in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness,2
25029,He came into all the region around the Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins,2
25030,As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet The voice of one crying in the wilderness Make ready the way of the Lord Make his paths straight,2
25031,Every valley will be filled Every mountain and hill will be brought low The crooked will become straight And the rough ways smooth,2
25032,All flesh will see Gods salvation,2
25033,He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him You offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come,2
25034,Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and dont begin to say among yourselves We have Abraham for our father for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!,2
25035,Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees Every tree therefore that doesnt bring forth good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,2
25036,The multitudes asked him What then must we do,2
25037,He answered them He who has two coats let him give to him who has none He who has food let him do likewise,2
25038,Tax collectors also came to be baptized and they said to him Teacher what must we do,2
25039,He said to them Collect no more than that which is appointed to you,2
25040,Soldiers also asked him saying What about us What must we do He said to them Extort from no one by violence neither accuse anyone wrongfully Be content with your wages,2
25041,As the people were in expectation and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John whether perhaps he was the Christ,2
25042,John answered them all I indeed baptize you with water but he comes who is mightier than I the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,2
25043,whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor and will gather the wheat into his barn but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire,2
25044,Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,2
25045,but Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for Herodias his brothersTR reads brother Philips instead of brothers wife and for all the evil things which Herod had done,2
25046,added this also to them all that he shut up John in prison,2
25047,Now it happened when all the people were baptized Jesus also had been baptized and was praying The sky was opened,2
25048,and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him and a voice came out of the sky saying You are my beloved Son In you I am well pleased,2

25065,Jesus full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,2
25066,for forty days being tempted by the devil He ate nothing in those days Afterward when they were completed he was hungry,2
25067,The devil said to him If you are the Son of God command this stone to become bread,2
25068,Jesus answered him saying It is written Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God,2
25069,The devil leading him up on a high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,2
25070,The devil said to him I will give you all this authority and their glory for it has been delivered to me and I give it to whomever I want,2
25071,If you therefore will worship before me it will all be yours,2
25072,Jesus answered him Get behind me Satan! For it is written You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve,2
25073,He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him If you are the Son of God cast yourself down from here,2
25074,for it is written He will give his angels charge concerning you to guard you,2
25075,and On their hands they will bear you up Lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone,2
25076,Jesus answering said to him It has been said You shall not tempt the Lord your God,2
25077,When the devil had completed every temptation he departed from him until another time,2
25078,Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee and news about him spread through all the surrounding area,2
25079,He taught in their synagogues being glorified by all,2
25080,He came to Nazareth where he had been brought up He entered as was his custom into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read,2
25081,The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him He opened the book and found the place where it was written,2
25082,The Spirit of the Lord is on me Because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted To proclaim release to the captives Recovering of sight to the blind To deliver those who are crushed,2
25083,And to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,2
25084,He closed the book gave it back to the attendant and sat down The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him,2
25085,He began to tell them Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,2
25086,All testified about him and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said Isnt this Josephs son,2
25087,He said to them Doubtless you will tell me this parable Physician heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum do also here in your hometown,2
25088,He said Most assuredly I tell you no prophet is acceptable in his hometown,2
25089,But truly I tell you there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was shut up three years and six months when a great famine came over all the land,2
25090,Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath in the land of Sidon to a woman who was a widow,2
25091,There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet yet not one of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian,2
25092,They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things,2
25093,They rose up threw him out of the city and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on that they might throw him off the cliff,2

25095,He came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,2
25096,and they were astonished at his teaching for his word was with authority,2
25097,In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice,2
25098,saying Ah! what have we to do with you Jesus of Nazareth Have you come to destroy us I know you who you are the Holy One of God!,2
25099,Jesus rebuked him saying Be silent and come out of him! When the demon had thrown him down in their midst he came out of him having done him no harm,2
25100,Amazement came on all and they spoke together one with another saying What is this word For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out!,2
25101,News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region,2
25102,He rose up from the synagogue and entered into Simons house Simons motherinlaw was afflicted with a great fever and they begged him for her,2
25103,He stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her Immediately she rose up and served them,2
25104,When the sun was setting all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them,2
25105,Demons also came out from many crying out and saying You are the Christ the Son of God! Rebuking them he didnt allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Christ,2
25106,When it was day he departed and went into an uninhabited place and the multitudes looked for him and came to him and held on to him so that he wouldnt go away from them,2
25107,But he said to them I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also For this reason I have been sent,2
25108,He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee,2
25109,Now it happened while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,2
25110,He saw two boats standing by the lake but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets,2
25111,He entered into one of the boats which was Simons and asked him to put out a little from the land He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat,2
25112,When he had finished speaking he said to Simon Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch,2
25113,Simon answered him Master we worked all night and took nothing but at your word I will let down the net,2
25114,When they had done this they caught a great multitude of fish and their net was breaking,2
25115,They beckoned to their partners in the other boat that they should come and help them They came and filled both boats so that they began to sink,2
25116,But Simon Peter when he saw it fell down at Jesus knees saying Depart from me for I am a sinful man Lord,2
25117,For he was amazed and all who were with him at the catch of fish which they had caught,2
25118,and so also were James and John sons of Zebedee who were partners with Simon Jesus said to Simon Dont be afraid From now on you will be catching people alive,2
25119,When they had brought their boats to land they left everything and followed him,2
25120,It happened while he was in one of the cities behold there was a man full of leprosy When he saw Jesus he fell on his face and begged him saying Lord if you want to you can make me clean,2
25121,He stretched out his hand and touched him saying I want to Be made clean Immediately the leprosy left him,2
25122,He charged him to tell no one But go your way and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded for a testimony to them,2
25123,But the report concerning him spread much more and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities,2
25124,But he withdrew himself into the desert and prayed,2
25125,It happened on one of those days that he was teaching and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by who had come out of every village of Galilee Judea and Jerusalem The power of the Lord was with him to heal them,2
25126,Behold men brought a paralyzed man on a cot and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus,2
25127,Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude they went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus,2
25128,Seeing their faith he said to him Man your sins are forgiven you,2
25129,The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying Who is this that speaks blasphemies Who can forgive sins but God alone,2
25130,But Jesus perceiving their thoughts answered them Why are you reasoning so in your hearts,2
25131,Which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven you or to say Arise and walk,2
25132,But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the paralyzed man I tell you arise and take up your cot and go to your house,2
25133,Immediately he rose up before them and took up that which he was laying on and departed to his house glorifying God,2
25134,Amazement took hold on all and they glorified God They were filled with fear saying We have seen strange things today,2
25135,After these things he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office and said to him Follow me!,2
25136,He left everything and rose up and followed him,2
25137,Levi made a great feast for him in his house There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them,2
25138,Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples saying Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners,2
25139,Jesus answered them Those who are healthy have no need for a physician but those who are sick do,2
25140,I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance,2
25141,They said to him Why do Johns disciples often fast and pray likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees but yours eat and drink,2
25142,He said to them Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them,2
25143,But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them Then they will fast in those days,2
25144,He also told a parable to them No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment or else he will tear the new and also the piece from the new will not match the old,2
25145,No one puts new wine into old wineskins or else the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed,2
25146,But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins and both are preserved,2
25147,No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new for he says The old is better,2
25148,Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first that he was going through the grain fields His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate rubbing them in their hands,2
25149,But some of the Pharisees said to them Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day,2
25150,Jesus answering them said Havent you read what David did when he was hungry he and those who were with him,2
25151,how he entered into the house of God and took and ate the show bread and gave also to those who were with him which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone,2
25152,He said to them The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath,2
25153,It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught There was a man there and his right hand was withered,2
25154,The scribes and the Pharisees watched him to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath that they might find an accusation against him,2
25155,But he knew their thoughts and he said to the man who had the withered hand Rise up and stand in the middle He arose and stood,2
25156,Then Jesus said to them I will ask you something Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm To save a life or to kill,2
25157,He looked around at them all and said to the man Stretch out your hand He did and his hand was restored as sound as the other,2
25158,But they were filled with rage and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus,2
25159,It happened in these days that he went out to the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to God,2
25160,When it was day he called his disciples and from them he chose twelve whom he also named apostles,2
25161,Simon whom he also named Peter Andrew his brother James John Philip Bartholomew,2
25162,Matthew Thomas James the son of Alphaeus Simon who was called the Zealot,2
25163,Judas the son of James and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor,2
25164,He came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of his disciples and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,2
25165,as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits and they were being healed,2
25166,All the multitude sought to touch him for power came out from him and healed them all,2
25167,He lifted up his eyes to his disciples and said Blessed are you who are poor For yours is the Kingdom of God,2
25168,Blessed are you who hunger now For you will be filled Blessed are you who weep now For you will laugh,2
25169,Blessed are you when men shall hate you and when they shall exclude and mock you and throw out your name as evil for the Son of Mans sake,2
25170,Rejoice in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets,2
25171,But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation,2
25172,Woe to you you who are full now! For you will be hungry Woe to you who laugh now! For you will mourn and weep,2
25173,WoeTR adds to you whenTR adds all men speak well of you! For their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets,2
25174,But I tell you who hear love your enemies do good to those who hate you,2
25175,bless those who curse you and pray for those who mistreat you,2
25176,To him who strikes you on the cheek offer also the other and from him who takes away your cloak dont withhold your coat also,2
25177,Give to everyone who asks you and dont ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again,2
25178,As you would like people to do to you do exactly so to them,2
25179,If you love those who love you what credit is that to you For even sinners love those who love them,2
25180,If you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you For even sinners do the same,2
25181,If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what credit is that to you Even sinners lend to sinners to receive back as much,2
25182,But love your enemies and do good and lend expecting nothing back and your reward will be great and you will be children of the Most High for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil,2
25183,Therefore be merciful Even as your Father is also merciful,2
25184,Dont judge And you wont be judged Dont condemn And you wont be condemned Set free And you will be set free,2
25185,Give and it will be given to you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will be given to youliterally into your bosom For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you,2
25186,He spoke a parable to them Can the blind guide the blind Wont they both fall into a pit,2
25187,A disciple is not above his teacher but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher,2
25188,Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brothers eye but dont consider the beam that is in your own eye,2
25189,Or how can you tell your brother Brother let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye when you yourself dont see the beam that is in your own eye You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brothers eye,2
25190,For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit,2
25191,For each tree is known by its own fruit For people dont gather figs from thorns nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush,2
25192,The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks,2
25193,Why do you call me Lord Lord and dont do the things which I say,2
25194,Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them I will show you who he is like,2
25195,He is like a man building a house who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock When a flood arose the stream broke against that house and could not shake it because it was founded on the rock,2
25196,But he who hears and doesnt do is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation against which the stream broke and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great,2
25197,After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people he entered into Capernaum,2
25198,A certain centurions servant who was dear to him was sick and at the point of death,2
25199,When he heard about Jesus he sent to him elders of the Jews asking him to come and save his servant,2
25200,When they came to Jesus they begged him earnestly saying He is worthy for you to do this for him,2
25201,for he loves our nation and he built our synagogue for us,2
25202,Jesus went with them When he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying to him Lord dont trouble yourself for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof,2
25203,Therefore I didnt even think myself worthy to come to you but say the word and my servant will be healed,2
25204,For I also am a man placed under authority having under myself soldiers I tell this one Go! and he goes and to another Come! and he comes and to my servant Do this and he does it,2
25205,When Jesus heard these things he marveled at him and turned and said to the multitude who followed him I tell you I have not found such great faith no not in Israel,2
25206,Those who were sent returning to the house found that the servant who had been sick was well,2
25207,It happened soon afterwards that he went to a city called Nain Many of his disciples along with a great multitude went with him,2
25208,Now when he drew near to the gate of the city behold one who was dead was carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow Many people of the city were with her,2
25209,When the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said to her Dont cry,2
25210,He came near and touched the coffin and the bearers stood still He said Young man I tell you arise!,2
25211,He who was dead sat up and began to speak And he gave him to his mother,2
25212,Fear took hold of all and they glorified God saying A great prophet has arisen among us! and God has visited his people!,2
25213,This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region,2
25214,The disciples of John told him about all these things,2
25215,John calling to himself two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying Are you the one who is coming or should we look for another,2
25216,When the men had come to him they said John the Baptizer has sent us to you saying Are you he who comes or should we look for another,2
25217,In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits and to many who were blind he gave sight,2
25218,Jesus answered them Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard that the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them,2
25219,Blessed is he who is not offended by me,2
25220,When Johns messengers had departed he began to tell the multitudes about John What did you go out into the wilderness to see A reed shaken by the wind,2
25221,But what did you go out to see A man clothed in soft clothing Behold those who are gorgeously dressed and live delicately are in kings courts,2
25222,But what did you go out to see A prophet Yes I tell you and much more than a prophet,2
25223,This is he of whom it is written Behold I send my messenger before your face Who will prepare your way before you,2
25224,For I tell you among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he,2
25225,When all the people and the tax collectors heard this they declared God to be just having been baptized with Johns baptism,2
25226,But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God not being baptized by him themselves,2
25227,But the Lord saidSo reads TR MT omits But the Lord said To what then will I liken the people of this generation What are they like,2
25228,They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call one to another saying We piped to you and you didnt dance We mourned and you didnt weep,2
25229,For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and you say He has a demon,2
25230,The Son of Man has come eating and drinking and you say Behold a gluttonous man and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners!,2
25231,Wisdom is justified by all her children,2
25232,One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him He entered into the Pharisees house and sat at the table,2
25233,Behold a woman in the city who was a sinner when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisees house she brought an alabaster jar of ointment,2
25234,Standing behind at his feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears and she wiped them with the hair of her head kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment,2
25235,Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it he said to himself This man if he were a prophet would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him that she is a sinner,2
25236,Jesus answered him Simon I have something to tell you He said Teacher say on,2
25237,A certain lender had two debtors The one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty,2
25238,When they couldnt pay he forgave them both Which of them therefore will love him most,2
25239,Simon answered He I suppose to whom he forgave the most He said to him You have judged correctly,2
25240,Turning to the woman he said to Simon Do you see this woman I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head,2
25241,You gave me no kiss but she since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet,2
25242,You didnt anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment,2
25243,Therefore I tell you her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much But to whom little is forgiven the same loves little,2
25244,He said to her Your sins are forgiven,2
25245,Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves Who is this who even forgives sins,2
25246,He said to the woman Your faith has saved you Go in peace,2
25247,It happened soon afterwards that he went about through cities and villages preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God With him were the twelve,2
25248,and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary who was called Magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out,2
25249,and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herods steward Susanna and many others who ministered to themTR reads him instead of them from their possessions,2
25250,When a great multitude came together and people from every city were coming to him he spoke by a parable,2
25251,The farmer went out to sow his seed As he sowed some fell along the road and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the sky devoured it,2
25252,Other seed fell on the rock and as soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture,2
25253,Other fell amid the thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it,2
25254,Other fell into the good ground and grew and brought forth fruit one hundred times As he said these things he called out He who has ears to hear let him hear!,2
25255,Then his disciples asked him What does this parable mean,2
25256,He said To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God but to the rest in parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand,2
25257,Now the parable is this The seed is the word of God,2
25258,Those along the road are those who hear then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved,2
25259,Those on the rock are they who when they hear receive the word with joy but these have no root who believe for a while then fall away in time of temptation,2
25260,That which fell among the thorns these are those who have heard and as they go on their way they are choked with cares riches and pleasures of life and bring no fruit to maturity,2
25261,That in the good ground these are such as in an honest and good heart having heard the word hold it tightly and bring forth fruit with patience,2
25262,No one when he has lit a lamp covers it with a container or puts it under a bed but puts it on a stand that those who enter in may see the light,2
25263,For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light,2
25264,Be careful therefore how you hear For whoever has to him will be given and whoever doesnt have from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has,2
25265,His mother and brothers came to him and they could not come near him for the crowd,2
25266,It was told him by some saying Your mother and your brothers stand outside desiring to see you,2
25267,But he answered them My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it,2
25268,Now it happened on one of those days that he entered into a boat himself and his disciples and he said to them Lets go over to the other side of the lake So they launched out,2
25269,But as they sailed he fell asleep A wind storm came down on the lake and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water,2
25270,They came to him and awoke him saying Master master we are dying! He awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and it was calm,2
25271,He said to them Where is your faith Being afraid they marveled saying one to another Who is this then that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him,2
25272,They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes which is opposite Galilee,2
25273,When Jesus stepped ashore a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him He wore no clothes and didnt live in a house but in the tombs,2
25274,When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said What do I have to do with you Jesus you Son of the Most High God I beg you dont torment me!,2
25275,For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man For the unclean spirit had often seized the man He was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters Breaking the bands apart he was driven by the demon into the desert,2
25276,Jesus asked him What is your name He said Legion for many demons had entered into him,2
25277,They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss,2
25278,Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those He allowed them,2
25279,The demons came out from the man and entered into the pigs and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned,2
25280,When those who fed them saw what had happened they fled and told it in the city and in the country,2
25281,People went out to see what had happened They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus feet clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid,2
25282,Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed,2
25283,All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them for they were very much afraid He entered into the boat and returned,2
25284,But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him but Jesus sent him away saying,2
25285,Return to your house and declare what great things God has done for you He went his way proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him,2
25286,It happened when Jesus returned that the multitude welcomed him for they were all waiting for him,2
25287,Behold there came a man named Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue He fell down at Jesus feet and begged him to come into his house,2
25288,for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age and she was dying But as he went the multitudes pressed against him,2
25289,A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years who had spent all her living on physicians and could not be healed by any,2
25290,came behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak and immediately the flow of her blood stopped,2
25291,Jesus said Who touched me When all denied it Peter and those with him said Master the multitudes press and jostle you and you say Who touched me,2
25292,But Jesus said Someone did touch me for I perceived that power has gone out of me,2
25293,When the woman saw that she was not hidden she came trembling and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him and how she was healed immediately,2
25294,He said to her Daughter cheer up Your faith has made you well Go in peace,2
25295,While he still spoke one from the ruler of the synagogues house came saying to him Your daughter is dead Dont trouble the Teacher,2
25296,But Jesus hearing it answered him Dont be afraid Only believe and she will be healed,2
25297,When he came to the house he didnt allow anyone to enter in except Peter John James the father of the child and her mother,2
25298,All were weeping and mourning her but he said Dont weep She isnt dead but sleeping,2
25299,They were ridiculing him knowing that she was dead,2
25300,But he put them all outside and taking her by the hand he called saying Child arise!,2
25301,Her spirit returned and she rose up immediately He commanded that something be given to her to eat,2
25302,Her parents were amazed but he charged them to tell no one what had been done,2
25303,He called the twelveTR reads his twelve disciples instead of the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,2
25304,He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick,2
25305,He said to them Take nothing for your journeyneither staffs nor wallet nor bread nor money neither have two coats apiece,2
25306,Into whatever house you enter stay there and depart from there,2
25307,As many as dont receive you when you depart from that city shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them,2
25308,They departed and went throughout the villages preaching the Gospel and healing everywhere,2
25309,Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was very perplexed because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,2
25310,and by some that Elijah had appeared and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again,2
25311,Herod said John I beheaded but who is this about whom I hear such things He sought to see him,2
25312,The apostles when they had returned told him what things they had done He took them and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida,2
25313,But the multitudes perceiving it followed him He welcomed them and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God and he cured those who needed healing,2
25314,The day began to wear away and the twelve came and said to him Send the multitude away that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms and lodge and get food for we are here in a deserted place,2
25315,But he said to them You give them something to eat They said We have no more than five loaves and two fish unless we should go and buy food for all these people,2
25316,For they were about five thousand men He said to his disciples Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each,2
25317,They did so and made them all sit down,2
25318,He took the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to the sky he blessed them and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude,2
25319,They ate and were all filled They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over,2
25320,It happened as he was praying alone that the disciples were with him and he asked them Who do the multitudes say that I am,2
25321,They answered John the Baptizer but others say Elijah and others that one of the old prophets is risen again,2
25322,He said to them But who do you say that I am Peter answered The Christ of God,2
25323,But he warned them and commanded them to tell this to no one,2
25324,saying The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third day be raised up,2
25325,He said to all If anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself take up his crossTR NU add daily and follow me,2
25326,For whoever desires to save his life will lose it but whoever will lose his life for my sake the same will save it,2
25327,For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits his own self,2
25328,For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels,2
25329,But I tell you the truth There are some of those who stand here who will in no way taste of death until they see the Kingdom of God,2
25330,It happened about eight days after these sayings that he took with him Peter John and James and went up onto the mountain to pray,2
25331,As he was praying the appearance of his face was altered and his clothing became white and dazzling,2
25332,Behold two men were talking with him who were Moses and Elijah,2
25333,who appeared in glory and spoke of his departureLiterally exodus which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem,2
25334,Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep but when they were fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him,2
25335,It happened as they were parting from him that Peter said to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here Lets make three tents one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah not knowing what he said,2
25336,While he said these things a cloud came and overshadowed them and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud,2
25337,A voice came out of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son Listen to him!,2
25338,When the voice came Jesus was found alone They were silent and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen,2
25339,It happened on the next day when they had come down from the mountain that a great multitude met him,2
25340,Behold a man from the crowd called out saying Teacher I beg you to look at my son for he is my only child,2
25341,Behold a spirit takes him he suddenly cries out and it convulses him so that he foams and it hardly departs from him bruising him severely,2
25342,I begged your disciples to cast it out and they couldnt,2
25343,Jesus answered Faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you and bear with you Bring your son here,2
25344,While he was still coming the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father,2
25345,They were all astonished at the majesty of God But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did he said to his disciples,2
25346,Let these words sink into your ears for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men,2
25347,But they didnt understand this saying It was concealed from them that they should not perceive it and they were afraid to ask him about this saying,2
25348,There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest,2
25349,Jesus perceiving the reasoning of their hearts took a little child and set him by his side,2
25350,and said to them Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me Whoever receives me receives him who sent me For whoever is least among you all this one will be great,2
25351,John answered Master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we forbade him because he doesnt follow with us,2
25352,Jesus said to him Dont forbid him for he who is not against us is for us,2
25353,It came to pass when the days were near that he should be taken up he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,2
25354,and sent messengers before his face They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans so as to prepare for him,2
25355,They didnt receive him because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem,2
25356,When his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them just as Elijah did,2
25357,But he turned and rebuked them You dont know of what kind of spirit you are,2
25358,For the Son of Man didnt come to destroy mens lives but to save them They went to another village,2
25359,As they went on the way a certain man said to him I want to follow you wherever you go Lord,2
25360,Jesus said to him The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head,2
25361,He said to another Follow me! But he said Lord allow me first to go and bury my father,2
25362,But Jesus said to him Leave the dead to bury their own dead but you go and announce the Kingdom of God,2
25363,Another also said I want to follow you Lord but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house,2
25364,But Jesus said to him No one having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the Kingdom of God,2
25365,Now after these things the Lord also appointed seventy others and sent them two by two ahead of himliterally before his face into every city and place where he was about to come,2
25366,Then he said to them The harvest is indeed plentiful but the laborers are few Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest that he may send out laborers into his harvest,2
25367,Go your ways Behold I send you out as lambs among wolves,2
25368,Carry no purse nor wallet nor sandals Greet no one on the way,2
25369,Into whatever house you enter first say Peace be to this house,2
25370,If a son of peace is there your peace will rest on him but if not it will return to you,2
25371,Remain in that same house eating and drinking the things they give for the laborer is worthy of his wages Dont go from house to house,2
25372,Into whatever city you enter and they receive you eat the things that are set before you,2
25373,Heal the sick who are therein and tell them The Kingdom of God has come near to you,2
25374,But into whatever city you enter and they dont receive you go out into the streets of it and say,2
25375,Even the dust from your city that clings to us we wipe off against you Nevertheless know this that the Kingdom of God has come near to you,2
25376,I tell you it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city,2
25377,Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes,2
25378,But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you,2
25379,You Capernaum who are exalted to heaven will be brought down to HadesHades is the lower realm of the dead or Hell,2
25380,Whoever listens to you listens to me and whoever rejects you rejects me Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me,2
25381,The seventy returned with joy saying Lord even the demons are subject to us in your name!,2
25382,He said to them I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven,2
25383,Behold I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy Nothing will in any way hurt you,2
25384,Nevertheless dont rejoice in this that the spirits are subject to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven,2
25385,In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said I thank you O Father Lord of heaven and earth that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children Yes Father for so it was wellpleasing in your sight,2
25386,Turning to the disciples he said All things have been delivered to me by my Father No one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him,2
25387,Turning to the disciples he said privately Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,2
25388,for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see and didnt see them and to hear the things which you hear and didnt hear them,2
25389,Behold a certain lawyer stood up and tested him saying Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life,2
25390,He said to him What is written in the law How do you read it,2
25391,He answered You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself,2
25392,He said to him You have answered correctly Do this and you will live,2
25393,But he desiring to justify himself asked Jesus Who is my neighbor,2
25394,Jesus answered A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among robbers who both stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead,2
25395,By chance a certain priest was going down that way When he saw him he passed by on the other side,2
25396,In the same way a Levite also when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side,2
25397,But a certain Samaritan as he traveled came where he was When he saw him he was moved with compassion,2
25398,came to him and bound up his wounds pouring on oil and wine He set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him,2
25399,On the next day when he departed he took out two denarii and gave them to the host and said to him Take care of him Whatever you spend beyond that I will repay you when I return,2
25400,Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers,2
25401,He said He who showed mercy on him Then Jesus said to him Go and do likewise,2
25402,It happened as they went on their way he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house,2
25403,She had a sister called Mary who also sat at Jesus feet and heard his word,2
25404,But Martha was distracted with much serving and she came up to him and said Lord dont you care that my sister left me to serve alone Ask her therefore to help me,2
25405,Jesus answered her Martha Martha you are anxious and troubled about many things,2
25406,but one thing is needed Mary has chosen the good part which will not be taken away from her,2
25407,It happened that when he finished praying in a certain place one of his disciples said to him Lord teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples,2
25408,He said to them When you pray say Our Father in heaven May your name be kept holy May your Kingdom come May your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven,2
25409,Give us day by day our daily bread,2
25410,Forgive us our sins For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us Bring us not into temptation But deliver us from the evil one,2
25411,He said to them Which of you if you go to a friend at midnight and tell him Friend lend me three loaves of bread,2
25412,for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to set before him,2
25413,and he from within will answer and say Dont bother me The door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cant get up and give it to you,2
25414,I tell you although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as many as he needs,2
25415,I tell you keep asking and it will be given you Keep seeking and you will find Keep knocking and it will be opened to you,2
25416,For everyone who asks receives He who seeks finds To him who knocks it will be opened,2
25417,Which of you fathers if your son asks for bread will give him a stone Or if he asks for a fish he wont give him a snake instead of a fish will he,2
25418,Or if he asks for an egg he wont give him a scorpion will he,2
25419,If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him,2
25420,He was casting out a demon and it was mute It happened when the demon had gone out the mute man spoke and the multitudes marveled,2
25421,But some of them said He casts out demons by Beelzebul the prince of the demons,2
25422,Others testing him sought from him a sign from heaven,2
25423,But he knowing their thoughts said to them Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation A house divided against itself falls,2
25424,If Satan also is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul,2
25425,But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul by whom do your children cast them out Therefore will they be your judges,2
25426,But if I by the finger of God cast out demons then the Kingdom of God has come to you,2
25427,When the strong man fully armed guards his own dwelling his goods are safe,2
25428,But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted and divides his spoils,2
25429,He that is not with me is against me He who doesnt gather with me scatters,2
25430,The unclean spirit when he has gone out of the man passes through dry places seeking rest and finding none he says I will turn back to my house from which I came out,2
25431,When he returns he finds it swept and put in order,2
25432,Then he goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell there The last state of that man becomes worse than the first,2
25433,It came to pass as he said these things a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice and said to him Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts which nursed you!,2
25434,But he said On the contrary blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it,2
25435,When the multitudes were gathering together to him he began to say This is an evil generation It seeks after a sign No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet,2
25436,For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites so will also the Son of Man be to this generation,2
25437,The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold one greater than Solomon is here,2
25438,The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold one greater than Jonah is here,2
25439,No man when he has lit a lamp puts it in a cellar nor under a basket but on a stand that those who enter in may see the light,2
25440,The lamp of the body is the eye Therefore when your eye is good your whole body is also full of light but when it is evil your body also is full of darkness,2
25441,Therefore see whether the light that is in you isnt darkness,2
25442,If therefore your whole body is full of light having no part dark it will be wholly full of light as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light,2
25443,Now as he spoke a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him He went in and sat at the table,2
25444,When the Pharisee saw it he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner,2
25445,The Lord said to him Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness,2
25446,You foolish ones didnt he who made the outside make the inside also,2
25447,But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within and behold all things will be clean to you,2
25448,But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb but you bypass justice and the love of God You ought to have done these and not to have left the other undone,2
25449,Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces,2
25450,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves and the men who walk over them dont know it,2
25451,One of the lawyers answered him Teacher in saying this you insult us also,2
25452,He said Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry and you yourselves wont even lift one finger to help carry those burdens,2
25453,Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets and your fathers killed them,2
25454,So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers For they killed them and you build their tombs,2
25455,Therefore also the wisdom of God said I will send to them prophets and apostles and some of them they will kill and persecute,2
25456,that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,2
25457,from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary Yes I tell you it will be required of this generation,2
25458,Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge You didnt enter in yourselves and those who were entering in you hindered,2
25459,As he said these things to them the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry and to draw many things out of him,2
25460,lying in wait for him and seeking to catch him in something he might say that they might accuse him,2
25461,Meanwhile when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together so much so that they trampled on each other he began to tell his disciples first of all Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy,2
25462,But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed nor hidden that will not be known,2
25463,Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops,2
25464,I tell you my friends dont be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do,2
25465,But I will warn you whom you should fear Fear him who after he has killed has power to cast into Gehennaor Hell Yes I tell you fear him,2
25466,Arent five sparrows sold for two assaria coinsAn assarion was a small copper coin worth about an hours wages for an agricultural laborer Not one of them is forgotten by God,2
25467,But the very hairs of your head are all numbered Therefore dont be afraid You are of more value than many sparrows,2
25468,I tell you everyone who confesses me before men him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God,2
25469,but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God,2
25470,Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven,2
25471,When they bring you before the synagogues the rulers and the authorities dont be anxious how or what you will answer or what you will say,2
25472,for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say,2
25473,One of the multitude said to him Teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me,2
25474,But he said to him Man who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you,2
25475,He said to them Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness for a mans life doesnt consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses,2
25476,He spoke a parable to them saying The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly,2
25477,He reasoned within himself saying What will I do because I dont have room to store my crops,2
25478,He said This is what I will do I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones and there I will store all my grain and my goods,2
25479,I will tell my soul Soul you have many goods laid up for many years Take your ease eat drink be merry,2
25480,But God said to him You foolish one tonight your soul is required of you The things which you have preparedwhose will they be,2
25481,So is he who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God,2
25482,He said to his disciples Therefore I tell you dont be anxious for your life what you will eat nor yet for your body what you will wear,2
25483,Life is more than food and the body is more than clothing,2
25484,Consider the ravens they dont sow they dont reap they have no warehouse or barn and God feeds them How much more valuable are you than birds!,2
25485,Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height,2
25486,If then you arent able to do even the least things why are you anxious about the rest,2
25487,Consider the lilies how they grow They dont toil neither do they spin yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these,2
25488,But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field which today exists and tomorrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you O you of little faith,2
25489,Dont seek what you will eat or what you will drink neither be anxious,2
25490,For the nations of the world seek after all of these things but your Father knows that you need these things,2
25491,But seek Gods Kingdom and all these things will be added to you,2
25492,Dont be afraid little flock for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom,2
25493,Sell that which you have and give gifts to the needy Make for yourselves purses which dont grow old a treasure in the heavens that doesnt fail where no thief approaches neither moth destroys,2
25494,For where your treasure is there will your heart be also,2
25495,Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning,2
25496,Be like men watching for their lord when he returns from the marriage feast that when he comes and knocks they may immediately open to him,2
25497,Blessed are those servants whom the lord will find watching when he comes Most assuredly I tell you that he will dress himself and make them recline and will come and serve them,2
25498,They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch and finds them so,2
25499,But know this that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into,2
25500,Therefore be ready also for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you dont expect him,2
25501,Peter said to him Lord are you telling this parable to us or to everybody,2
25502,The Lord said Who then is the faithful and wise steward whom his lord will set over his household to give them their portion of food at the right times,2
25503,Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes,2
25504,Truly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has,2
25505,But if that servant says in his heart My lord delays his coming and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants and to eat and drink and to be drunken,2
25506,then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isnt expecting him and in an hour that he doesnt know and will cut him in two and place his portion with the unfaithful,2
25507,That servant who knew his lords will and didnt prepare nor do what he wanted will be beaten with many stripes,2
25508,but he who didnt know and did things worthy of stripes will be beaten with few stripes To whoever much is given of him will much be required and to whom much was entrusted of him more will be asked,2
25509,I came to throw fire on the earth I wish it were already kindled,2
25510,But I have a baptism to be baptized with and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!,2
25511,Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth I tell you no but rather division,2
25512,For from now on there will be five in one house divided three against two and two against three,2
25513,They will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against her mother motherinlaw against her daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw,2
25514,He said to the multitudes also When you see a cloud rising from the west immediately you say A shower is coming and so it happens,2
25515,When a south wind blows you say There will be a scorching heat and it happens,2
25516,You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky but how is it that you dont interpret this time,2
25517,Why dont you judge for yourselves what is right,2
25518,For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate try diligently on the way to be released from him lest perhaps he drag you to the judge and the judge deliver you to the officer and the officer throw you into prison,2
25519,I tell you you will by no means get out of there until you have paid the very last pennyLiterally lepton A lepton is a very small brass Jewish coin worth half a Roman quadrans each which is worth a quarter of the copper assarion Lepta are worth less than 1 of an agricultural workers daily wages,2
25520,Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices,2
25521,Jesus answered them Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered such things,2
25522,I tell you no but unless you repent you will all perish in the same way,2
25523,Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem,2
25524,I tell you no but unless you repent you will all perish in the same way,2
25525,He spoke this parable A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit on it and found none,2
25526,He said to the vine dresser Behold these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and found none Cut it down Why does it waste the soil,2
25527,He answered Lord leave it alone this year also until I dig around it and fertilize it,2
25528,If it bears fruit fine but if not after that you can cut it down,2
25529,He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day,2
25530,Behold there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and she was bent over and could in no way straighten herself up,2
25531,When Jesus saw her he called her and said to her Woman you are freed from your infirmity,2
25532,He laid his hands on her and immediately she stood up straight and glorified God,2
25533,The ruler of the synagogue being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath said to the multitude There are six days in which men ought to work Therefore come on those days and be healed and not on the Sabbath day!,2
25534,Therefore the Lord answered him You hypocrites! Doesnt each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath and lead him away to water,2
25535,Ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan had bound eighteen long years be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day,2
25536,As he said these things all his adversaries were disappointed and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him,2
25537,He said What is the Kingdom of God like To what shall I compare it,2
25538,It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his own garden It grew and became a large tree and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches,2
25539,Again he said To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God,2
25540,It is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measuresliterally three sata 3 sata is about 39 litres or a bit more than a bushel of flour until it was all leavened,2
25541,He went on his way through cities and villages teaching and traveling on to Jerusalem,2
25542,One said to him Lord are they few who are saved He said to them,2
25543,Strive to enter in by the narrow door for many I tell you will seek to enter in and will not be able,2
25544,When once the master of the house has risen up and has shut the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door saying Lord Lord open to us! then he will answer and tell you I dont know you or where you come from,2
25545,Then you will begin to say We ate and drink in your presence and you taught in our streets,2
25546,He will say I tell you I dont know where you come from Depart from me all you workers of iniquity,2
25547,There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham Isaac Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God and yourselves being thrown outside,2
25548,They will come from the east west north and south and will sit down in the Kingdom of God,2
25549,Behold there are some who are last who will be first and there are some who are first who will be last,2
25550,On that same day some Pharisees came saying to him Get out of here and go away for Herod wants to kill you,2
25551,He said to them Go and tell that fox Behold I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow and the third day I complete my mission,2
25552,Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day for it cant be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem,2
25553,Jerusalem Jerusalem that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings and you refused!,2
25554,Behold your house is left to you desolate I tell you you will not see me until you say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!,2
25555,It happened when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread that they were watching him,2
25556,Behold a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him,2
25557,Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees saying Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath,2
25558,But they were silent He took him and healed him and let him go,2
25559,He answered them Which of you if your sonTR reads donkey instead of son or an ox fell into a well wouldnt immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day,2
25560,They couldnt answer him regarding these things,2
25561,He spoke a parable to those who were invited when he noticed how they chose the best seats and said to them,2
25562,When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast dont sit in the best seat since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,2
25563,and he who invited both of you would come and tell you Make room for this person Then you would begin with shame to take the lowest place,2
25564,But when you are invited go and sit in the lowest place so that when he who invited you comes he may tell you Friend move up higher Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you,2
25565,For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted,2
25566,He also said to the one who had invited him When you make a dinner or a supper dont call your friends nor your brothers nor your kinsmen nor rich neighbors or perhaps they might also return the favor and pay you back,2
25567,But when you make a feast ask the poor the maimed the lame or the blind,2
25568,and you will be blessed because they dont have the resources to repay you For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous,2
25569,When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things he said to him Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!,2
25570,But he said to him A certain man made a great supper and he invited many people,2
25571,He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited Come for everything is ready now,2
25572,They all as one began to make excuses The first said to him I have bought a field and I must go and see it Please have me excused,2
25573,Another said I have bought five yoke of oxen and I must go try them out Please have me excused,2
25574,Another said I have married a wife and therefore I cant come,2
25575,That servant came and told his lord these things Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in the poor maimed blind and lame,2
25576,The servant said Lord it is done as you commanded and there is still room,2
25577,The lord said to the servant Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled,2
25578,For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper,2
25579,Now great multitudes were going with him He turned and said to them,2
25580,If anyone comes to me and doesnt hate his own father mother wife children brothers and sisters yes and his own life also he cant be my disciple,2
25581,Whoever doesnt bear his own cross and come after me cant be my disciple,2
25582,For which of you desiring to build a tower doesnt first sit down and count the cost to see if he has enough to complete it,2
25583,Or perhaps when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish everyone who sees begins to mock him,2
25584,saying This man began to build and wasnt able to finish,2
25585,Or what king as he goes to encounter another king in war will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand,2
25586,Or else while the other is yet a great way off he sends an envoy and asks for conditions of peace,2
25587,So therefore whoever of you who doesnt renounce all that he has he cant be my disciple,2
25588,Salt is good but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless with what do you season it,2
25589,It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile It is thrown out He who has ears to hear let him hear,2
25590,Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him,2
25591,The Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying This man welcomes sinners and eats with them,2
25592,He told them this parable,2
25593,Which of you men if you had one hundred sheep and lost one of them wouldnt leave the ninetynine in the wilderness and go after the one that was lost until he found it,2
25594,When he has found it he carries it on his shoulders rejoicing,2
25595,When he comes home he calls together his friends and his neighbors saying to them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost!,2
25596,I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninetynine righteous people who need no repentance,2
25597,Or what woman if she had ten drachmaA drachma coin was worth about 2 days wages for an agricultural laborer coins if she lost one drachma coin wouldnt light a lamp sweep the house and seek diligently until she found it,2
25598,When she has found it she calls together her friends and neighbors saying Rejoice with me for I have found the drachma which I had lost,2
25599,Even so I tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting,2
25600,He said A certain man had two sons,2
25601,The younger of them said to his father Father give me my share of your property He divided his livelihood between them,2
25602,Not many days after the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country There he wasted his property with riotous living,2
25603,When he had spent all of it there arose a severe famine in that country and he began to be in need,2
25604,He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs,2
25605,He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate but no one gave him any,2
25606,But when he came to himself he said How many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare and Im dying with hunger!,2
25607,I will get up and go to my father and will tell him Father I have sinned against heaven and in your sight,2
25608,I am no more worthy to be called your son Make me as one of your hired servants,2
25609,He arose and came to his father But while he was still far off his father saw him and was moved with compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him,2
25610,The son said to him Father I have sinned against heaven and in your sight I am no longer worthy to be called your son,2
25611,But the father said to his servants Bring out the best robe and put it on him Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet,2
25612,Bring the fattened calf kill it and let us eat and celebrate,2
25613,for this my son was dead and is alive again He was lost and is found They began to celebrate,2
25614,Now his elder son was in the field As he came near to the house he heard music and dancing,2
25615,He called one of the servants to him and asked what was going on,2
25616,He said to him Your brother has come and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and healthy,2
25617,But he was angry and would not go in Therefore his father came out and begged him,2
25618,But he answered his father Behold these many years I have served you and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours but you never gave me a goat that I might celebrate with my friends,2
25619,But when this your son came who has devoured your living with prostitutes you killed the fattened calf for him,2
25620,He said to him Son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours,2
25621,But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad for this your brother was dead and is alive again He was lost and is found,2
25622,He also said to his disciples There was a certain rich man who had a manager An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions,2
25623,He called him and said to him What is this that I hear about you Give an accounting of your management for you can no longer be manager,2
25624,The manager said within himself What will I do seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me I dont have strength to dig I am ashamed to beg,2
25625,I know what I will do so that when I am removed from management they may receive me into their houses,2
25626,Calling each one of his lords debtors to him he said to the first How much do you owe to my lord,2
25627,He said A hundred batos100 batos is about 395 litres 104 U S gallons or 87 imperial gallons of oil He said to him Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty,2
25628,Then said he to another How much do you owe He said A hundred cors 100 cors  about 3910 litres or 600 bushels  of wheat He said to him Take your bill and write eighty,2
25629,His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their own generation wiser than the children of the light,2
25630,I tell you make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon so that when you fail they may receive you into the eternal tents,2
25631,He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much,2
25632,If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches,2
25633,If you have not been faithful in that which is anothers who will give you that which is your own,2
25634,No servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other You arent able to serve God and mammonMammon refers to riches or a false god of wealth,2
25635,The Pharisees who were lovers of money also heard all these things and they scoffed at him,2
25636,He said to them You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men but God knows your hearts For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God,2
25637,The law and the prophets were until John From that time the Gospel of the Kingdom of God is preached and everyone is forcing his way into it,2
25638,But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall,2
25639,Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery,2
25640,Now there was a certain rich man and he was clothed in purple and fine linen living in luxury every day,2
25641,A certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate full of sores,2
25642,and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich mans table Yes even the dogs came and licked his sores,2
25643,It happened that the beggar died and that he was carried away by the angels to Abrahams bosom The rich man also died and was buried,2
25644,In Hades he lifted up his eyes being in torment and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his bosom,2
25645,He cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame,2
25646,But Abraham said Son remember that you in your lifetime received your good things and Lazarus in like manner bad things But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish,2
25647,Besides all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed that those who want to pass from here to you are not able and that none may cross over from there to us,2
25648,He said I ask you therefore father that you would send him to my fathers house,2
25649,for I have five brothers that he may testify to them so they wont also come into this place of torment,2
25650,But Abraham said to him They have Moses and the prophets Let them listen to them,2
25651,He said No father Abraham but if one goes to them from the dead they will repent,2
25652,He said to him If they dont listen to Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead,2
25653,He said to the disciples It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come but woe to him through whom they come!,2
25654,It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble,2
25655,Be careful If your brother sins against you rebuke him If he repents forgive him,2
25656,If he sins against you seven times in the day and seven times returns saying I repent you shall forgive him,2
25657,The apostles said to the Lord Increase our faith,2
25658,The Lord said If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed you would tell this sycamore tree Be uprooted and be planted in the sea and it would obey you,2
25659,But who is there among you having a servant plowing or keeping sheep that will say when he comes in from the field Come immediately and sit down at the table,2
25660,and will not rather tell him Prepare my supper clothe yourself properly and serve me while I eat and drink Afterward you shall eat and drink,2
25661,Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded I think not,2
25662,Even so you also when you have done all the things that are commanded you say We are unworthy servants We have done our duty,2
25663,It happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee,2
25664,As he entered into a certain village ten men who were lepers met him who stood at a distance,2
25665,They lifted up their voices saying Jesus Master have mercy on us!,2
25666,When he saw them he said to them Go and show yourselves to the priests It happened that as they went they were cleansed,2
25667,One of them when he saw that he was healed turned back glorifying God with a loud voice,2
25668,He fell on his face at Jesus feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan,2
25669,Jesus answered Werent the ten cleansed But where are the nine,2
25670,Were there none found who returned to give glory to God except this stranger,2
25671,Then he said to him Get up and go your way Your faith has healed you,2
25672,Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come he answered them The Kingdom of God doesnt come with observation,2
25673,neither will they say Look here! or Look there! for behold the Kingdom of God is within you,2
25674,He said to the disciples The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man and you will not see it,2
25675,They will tell you Look here! or Look there! Dont go away nor follow after them,2
25676,for as the lightning when it flashes out of the one part under the sky shines to the other part under the sky so will the Son of Man be in his day,2
25677,But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation,2
25678,As it happened in the days of Noah even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man,2
25679,They ate they drank they married they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all,2
25680,Likewise even as it happened in the days of Lot they ate they drank they bought they sold they planted they built,2
25681,but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and sulfur from the sky and destroyed them all,2
25682,It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed,2
25683,In that day he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house let him not go down to take them away Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back,2
25684,Remember Lots wife!,2
25685,Whoever seeks to save his life loses it but whoever loses his life preserves it,2
25686,I tell you in that night there will be two people in one bed The one will be taken and the other will be left,2
25687,There will be two grinding grain together One will be taken and the other will be left,2
25688,Some Greek manuscripts add Two will be in the field the one taken and the other left,2
25689,They answering asked him Where Lord He said to them Where the body is there will the vultures also be gathered together,2
25690,He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray and not give up,2
25691,saying There was a judge in a certain city who didnt fear God and didnt respect man,2
25692,A widow was in that city and she often came to him saying Defend me from my adversary!,2
25693,He wouldnt for a while but afterward he said to himself Though I neither fear God nor respect man,2
25694,yet because this widow bothers me I will defend her or else she will wear me out by her continual coming,2
25695,The Lord said Listen to what the unrighteous judge says,2
25696,Wont God avenge his chosen ones who are crying out to him day and night and yet he exercises patience with them,2
25697,I tell you that he will avenge them quickly Nevertheless when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth,2
25698,He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness and who despised all others,2
25699,Two men went up into the temple to pray one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector,2
25700,The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this God I thank you that I am not like the rest of men extortioners unrighteous adulterers or even like this tax collector,2
25701,I fast twice a week I give tithes of all that I get,2
25702,But the tax collector standing far away wouldnt even lift up his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner!,2
25703,I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled but he who humbles himself will be exalted,2
25704,They were also bringing their babies to him that he might touch them But when the disciples saw it they rebuked them,2
25705,Jesus summoned them saying Allow the little children to come to me and dont hinder them for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these,2
25706,Most assuredly I tell you whoever doesnt receive the Kingdom of God like a little child he will in no way enter into it,2
25707,A certain ruler asked him saying Good Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life,2
25708,Jesus asked him Why do you call me good No one is good except oneGod,2
25709,You know the commandments Dont commit adultery Dont murder Dont steal Dont give false testimony Honor your father and your mother,2
25710,He said I have observed all these things from my youth up,2
25711,When Jesus heard these things he said to him You still lack one thing Sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor You will have treasure in heaven Come follow me,2
25712,But when he heard these things he became very sad for he was very rich,2
25713,Jesus seeing that he became very sad said How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!,2
25714,For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God,2
25715,Those who heard it said Then who can be saved,2
25716,But he said The things which are impossible with men are possible with God,2
25717,Peter said Look we have left everything and followed you,2
25718,He said to them Most assuredly I tell you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the Kingdom of Gods sake,2
25719,who will not receive many times more in this time and in the world to come eternal life,2
25720,He took the twelve aside and said to them Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed,2
25721,For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles will be mocked treated shamefully and spit on,2
25722,They will scourge and kill him On the third day he will rise again,2
25723,They understood none of these things This saying was hidden from them and they didnt understand the things that were said,2
25724,It happened as he came near Jericho a certain blind man sat by the road begging,2
25725,Hearing a multitude going by he asked what this meant,2
25726,They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by,2
25727,He cried out Jesus you son of David have mercy on me!,2
25728,Those who led the way rebuked him that he should be quiet but he cried out all the more You son of David have mercy on me!,2
25729,Standing still Jesus commanded him to be brought to him When he had come near he asked him,2
25730,What do you want me to do He said Lord that I may see again,2
25731,Jesus said to him Receive your sight Your faith has healed you,2
25732,Immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying God All the people when they saw it praised God,2
25733,He entered and was passing through Jericho,2
25734,There was a man named Zacchaeus He was a chief tax collector and he was rich,2
25735,He was trying to see who Jesus was and couldnt because of the crowd because he was short,2
25736,He ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way,2
25737,When Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said to him Zacchaeus hurry and come down for today I must stay at your house,2
25738,He hurried came down and received him joyfully,2
25739,When they saw it they all murmured saying He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner,2
25740,Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord Behold Lord half of my goods I give to the poor If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone I restore four times as much,2
25741,Jesus said to him Today salvation has come to this house because he also is a son of Abraham,2
25742,For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost,2
25743,As they heard these things he went on and told a parable because he was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately,2
25744,He said therefore A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return,2
25745,He called ten servants of his and gave them ten mina coins10 minas was more than 3 years wages for an agricultural laborer and told them Conduct business until I come,2
25746,But his citizens hated him and sent an envoy after him saying We dont want this man to reign over us,2
25747,It happened when he had come back again having received the kingdom that he commanded these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him that he might know what they had gained by conducting business,2
25748,The first came before him saying Lord your mina has made ten more minas,2
25749,He said to him Well done you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little you shall have authority over ten cities,2
25750,The second came saying Your mina Lord has made five minas,2
25751,So he said to him And you are to be over five cities,2
25752,Another came saying Lord behold your mina which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,2
25753,for I feared you because you are an exacting man You take up that which you didnt lay down and reap that which you didnt sow,2
25754,He said to him Out of your own mouth will I judge you you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man taking up that which I didnt lay down and reaping that which I didnt sow,2
25755,Then why didnt you deposit my money in the bank and at my coming I might have earned interest on it,2
25756,He said to those who stood by Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas,2
25757,They said to him Lord he has ten minas!,2
25758,For I tell you that to everyone who has will more be given but from him who doesnt have even that which he has will be taken away from him,2
25759,But bring those enemies of mine who didnt want me to reign over them here and kill them before me,2
25760,Having said these things he went on ahead going up to Jerusalem,2
25761,It happened when he drew near to BethsphageTR NU read Bethpage instead of Bethsphage and Bethany at the mountain that is called Olivet he sent two of his disciples,2
25762,saying Go your way into the village on the other side in which as you enter you will find a colt tied whereon no man ever yet sat Untie it and bring it,2
25763,If anyone asks you Why are you untying it say to him The Lord needs it,2
25764,Those who were sent went away and found things just as he had told them,2
25765,As they were untying the colt the owners of it said to them Why are you untying the colt,2
25766,They said The Lord needs it,2
25767,They brought it to Jesus They threw their cloaks on the colt and set Jesus on them,2
25768,As he went they spread their cloaks in the way,2
25769,As he was now getting near at the descent of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,2
25770,saying Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!,2
25771,Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him Teacher rebuke your disciples!,2
25772,He answered them I tell you that if these were silent the stones would cry out,2
25773,When he drew near he saw the city and wept over it,2
25774,saying If you even you had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes,2
25775,For the days will come on you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you surround you hem you in on every side,2
25776,and will dash you and your children within you to the ground They will not leave in you one stone on another because you didnt know the time of your visitation,2
25777,He entered into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,2
25778,saying to them It is written My house is a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers!,2
25779,He was teaching daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him,2
25780,They couldnt find what they might do for all the people hung on to every word that he said,2
25781,It happened on one of those days as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Gospel that the TR adds chiefpriests and scribes came to him with the elders,2
25782,They asked him Tell us by what authority do you do these things Or who is giving you this authority,2
25783,He answered them I also will ask you one question Tell me,2
25784,the baptism of John was it from heaven or from men,2
25785,They reasoned with themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say Why didnt you believe him,2
25786,But if we say From men all the people will stone us for they are persuaded that John was a prophet,2
25787,They answered that they didnt know where it was from,2
25788,Jesus said to them Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things,2
25789,He began to tell the people this parable A NU in brackets and TR add certainman planted a vineyard and rented it out to some farmers and went into another country for a long time,2
25790,At the proper season he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty,2
25791,He sent yet another servant and they also beat him and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty,2
25792,He sent yet a third and they also wounded him and threw him out,2
25793,The lord of the vineyard said What shall I do I will send my beloved son It may be that seeing him they will respect him,2
25794,But when the farmers saw him they reasoned among themselves saying This is the heir Come lets kill him that the inheritance may be ours,2
25795,They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them,2
25796,He will come and destroy these farmers and will give the vineyard to others When they heard it they said May it never be!,2
25797,But he looked at them and said Then what is this that is written The stone which the builders rejected The same was made the chief cornerstone,2
25798,Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces But it will crush whomever it falls on to dust,2
25799,The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him that very hour but they feared the peoplefor they knew He had spoken this parable against them,2
25800,They watched him and sent out spies who pretended to be righteous that they might trap him in something he said so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor,2
25801,They asked him Teacher we know that you say and teach what is right and arent partial to anyone but truly teach the way of God,2
25802,Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not,2
25803,But he perceived their craftiness and said to them Why do you test me,2
25804,Show me a denarius Whose image and inscription are on it They answered Caesars,2
25805,He said to them Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are Gods,2
25806,They werent able to trap him in his words before the people They marveled at his answer and were silent,2
25807,Some of the Sadducees came to him those who deny that there is a resurrection,2
25808,They asked him Teacher Moses wrote to us that if a mans brother dies having a wife and he is childless his brother should take the wife and raise up children for his brother,2
25809,There were therefore seven brothers The first took a wife and died childless,2
25810,The second took her as wife and he died childless,2
25811,The third took her and likewise the seven all left no children and died,2
25812,Afterward the woman also died,2
25813,Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be For the seven had her as a wife,2
25814,Jesus said to them The children of this age marry and are given in marriage,2
25815,But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,2
25816,For they cant die any more for they are like the angels and are children of God being children of the resurrection,2
25817,But that the dead are raised even Moses showed at the bush when he called the Lord The God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,2
25818,Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living for all are alive to him,2
25819,Some of the scribes answered Teacher you speak well,2
25820,They didnt dare to ask him any more questions,2
25821,He said to them Why do they say that the Christ is Davids son,2
25822,David himself says in the book of Psalms The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand,2
25823,Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet,2
25824,David therefore calls him Lord so how is he his son,2
25825,In the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,2
25826,Beware of the scribes who like to walk in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces the best seats in the synagogues and the best places at feasts,2
25827,who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers these will receive greater condemnation,2
25828,He looked up and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury,2
25829,He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coinsliterally two lepta 2 lepta was about 1 of a days wages for an agricultural laborer,2
25830,He said Truly I tell you this poor widow put in more than all of them,2
25831,for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on,2
25832,As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts he said,2
25833,As for these things which you see the days will come in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down,2
25834,They asked him Teacher so when will these things be What is the sign that these things are about to happen,2
25835,He said Watch out that you dont get led astray for many will come in my name saying I AM and The time is at hand Therefore dont follow them,2
25836,When you hear of wars and disturbances dont be terrified for these things must happen first but the end wont come immediately,2
25837,Then he said to them Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,2
25838,There will be great earthquakes famines and plagues in various places There will be terrors and great signs from heaven,2
25839,But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you delivering you up to synagogues and prisons bringing you before kings and governors for my names sake,2
25840,It will turn out as a testimony for you,2
25841,Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,2
25842,for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict,2
25843,You will be handed over even by parents brothers relatives and friends Some of you they will cause to be put to death,2
25844,You will be hated by all men for my names sake,2
25845,And not a hair of your head will perish,2
25846,By your endurance you will win your lives,2
25847,But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation is at hand,2
25848,Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains Let those who are in the midst of her depart Let those who are in the country not enter therein,2
25849,For these are days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled,2
25850,Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath to this people,2
25851,They will fall by the edge of the sword and will be led captive into all the nations Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled,2
25852,There will be signs in the sun moon and stars and on the earth anxiety of nations in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves,2
25853,men fainting for fear and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world for the powers of the heavens will be shaken,2
25854,Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory,2
25855,But when these things begin to happen look up and lift up your heads because your redemption is near,2
25856,He told them a parable See the fig tree and all the trees,2
25857,When they are already budding you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near,2
25858,Even so you also when you see these things happening know that the Kingdom of God is near,2
25859,Most assuredly I tell you this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished,2
25860,Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will by no means pass away,2
25861,So be careful or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing drunkenness and cares of this life and that day will come on you suddenly,2
25862,For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth,2
25863,Therefore be watchful all the time asking that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen and to stand before the Son of Man,2
25864,Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet,2
25865,All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him,2
25866,Now the feast of unleavened bread which is called the Passover drew near,2
25867,The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death for they feared the people,2
25868,Satan entered into Judas who was surnamed Iscariot who was numbered with the twelve,2
25869,He went away and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them,2
25870,They were glad and agreed to give him money,2
25871,He consented and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude,2
25872,The day of unleavened bread came on which the Passover must be sacrificed,2
25873,He sent Peter and John saying Go and prepare the Passover for us that we may eat,2
25874,They said to him Where do you want us to prepare,2
25875,He said to them Behold when you have entered into the city a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you Follow him into the house which he enters,2
25876,Tell the master of the house The Teacher says to you Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples,2
25877,He will show you a large furnished upper room Make preparations there,2
25878,They went found things as he had told them and they prepared the Passover,2
25879,When the hour had come he sat down with the twelve apostles,2
25880,He said to them I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,2
25881,for I tell you I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God,2
25882,He received a cup and when he had given thanks he said Take this and share it among yourselves,2
25883,for I tell you I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes,2
25884,He took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave to them saying This is my body which is given for you Do this in memory of me,2
25885,Likewise he took the cup after supper saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you,2
25886,But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table,2
25887,The Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!,2
25888,They began to question among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing,2
25889,There arose also a contention among them which of them was considered to be greatest,2
25890,He said to them The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them and those who have authority over them are called benefactors,2
25891,But not so with you But one who is the greater among you let him become as the younger and one who is governing as one who serves,2
25892,For who is greater one who sits at the table or one who serves Isnt it he who sits at the table But I am in the midst of you as one who serves,2
25893,But you are those who have continued with me in my trials,2
25894,I confer on you a kingdom even as my Father conferred on me,2
25895,that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom You will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel,2
25896,The Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan asked to have you that he might sift you as wheat,2
25897,but I prayed for you that your faith wouldnt fail You when once you have turned again establish your brothersThe word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings,2
25898,He said to him Lord I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!,2
25899,He said I tell you Peter the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times,2
25900,He said to them When I sent you out without purse and wallet and shoes did you lack anything They said Nothing,2
25901,Then he said to them But now whoever has a purse let him take it and likewise a wallet Whoever has none let him sell his cloak and buy a sword,2
25902,For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me He was counted with the lawless For that which concerns me has an end,2
25903,They said Lord behold here are two swords He said to them That is enough,2
25904,He came out and went as his custom was to the Mount of Olives His disciples also followed him,2
25905,When he was at the place he said to them Pray that you dont enter into temptation,2
25906,He was withdrawn from them about a stones throw and he knelt down and prayed,2
25907,saying Father if you are willing remove this cup from me Nevertheless not my will but yours be done,2
25908,An angel from heaven appeared to him strengthening him,2
25909,Being in agony he prayed more earnestly His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground,2
25910,When he rose up from his prayer he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief,2
25911,and said to them Why do you sleep Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation,2
25912,While he was still speaking behold a multitude and he who was called Judas one of the twelve was leading them He came near to Jesus to kiss him,2
25913,But Jesus said to him Judas do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss,2
25914,When those who were around him saw what was about to happen they said to him Lord shall we strike with the sword,2
25915,A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear,2
25916,But Jesus answered Let me at least do thisand he touched his ear and healed him,2
25917,Jesus said to the chief priests captains of the temple and elders who had come against him Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs,2
25918,When I was with you in the temple daily you didnt stretch out your hands against me But this is your hour and the power of darkness,2
25919,They seized him and led him away and brought him into the high priests house But Peter followed from a distance,2
25920,When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together Peter sat among them,2
25921,A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light and looking intently at him said This man also was with him,2
25922,He denied Jesus saying Woman I dont know him,2
25923,After a little while someone else saw him and said You also are one of them! But Peter answered Man I am not!,2
25924,After about one hour passed another confidently affirmed saying Truly this man also was with him for he is a Galilean!,2
25925,But Peter said Man I dont know what you are talking about! Immediately while he was still speaking a rooster crowed,2
25926,The Lord turned and looked at Peter Then Peter remembered the Lords word how he said to him Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times,2
25927,He went out and wept bitterly,2
25928,The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him,2
25929,Having blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you,2
25930,They spoke many other things against him insulting him,2
25931,As soon as it was day the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together both chief priests and scribes and they led him away into their council saying,2
25932,If you are the Christ tell us But he said to them If I tell you you wont believe,2
25933,and if I ask you will in no way answer me or let me go,2
25934,From now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God,2
25935,They all said Are you then the Son of God He said to them You say it because I AM,2
25936,They said Why do we need any more witness For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!,2
25937,The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate,2
25938,They began to accuse him saying We found this man perverting the nation forbidding paying taxes to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king,2
25939,Pilate asked him Are you the King of the Jews He answered him So you say,2
25940,Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes I find no basis for a charge against this man,2
25941,But they insisted saying He stirs up the people teaching throughout all Judea beginning from Galilee even to this place,2
25942,But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned he asked if the man was a Galilean,2
25943,When he found out that he was in Herods jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who was also in Jerusalem during those days,2
25944,Now when Herod saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad for he had wanted to see him for a long time because he had heard many things about him He hoped to see some miracle done by him,2
25945,He questioned him with many words but he gave no answers,2
25946,The chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him,2
25947,Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him Dressing him in luxurious clothing they sent him back to Pilate,2
25948,Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day for before that they were enemies with each other,2
25949,Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,2
25950,and said to them You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people and see I have examined him before you and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him,2
25951,Neither has Herod for I sent you to him and see nothing worthy of death has been done by him,2
25952,I will therefore chastise him and release him,2
25953,Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast,2
25954,But they all cried out together saying Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas! ,2
25955,one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city and for murder,2
25956,Then Pilate spoke to them again wanting to release Jesus,2
25957,but they shouted saying Crucify! Crucify him!,2
25958,He said to them the third time Why What evil has this man done I have found no capital crime in him I will therefore chastise him and release him,2
25959,But they were urgent with loud voices asking that he might be crucified Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed,2
25960,Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done,2
25961,He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder for whom they asked but he delivered Jesus up to their will,2
25962,When they led him away they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene coming from the country and laid on him the cross to carry it after Jesus,2
25963,A great multitude of the people followed him including women who also mourned and lamented him,2
25964,But Jesus turning to them said Daughters of Jerusalem dont weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children,2
25965,For behold the days are coming in which they will say Blessed are the barren the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed,2
25966,Then they will begin to tell the mountains Fall on us! and tell the hills Cover us,2
25967,For if they do these things in the green tree what will be done in the dry,2
25968,There were also others two criminals led with him to be put to death,2
25969,When they came to the place that is called The Skull they crucified him there with the criminals one on the right and the other on the left,2
25970,Jesus said Father forgive them for they dont know what they are doing Dividing his garments among them they cast lots,2
25971,The people stood watching The rulers with them also scoffed at him saying He saved others Let him save himself if this is the Christ of God his chosen one!,2
25972,The soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar,2
25973,and saying If you are the King of the Jews save yourself!,2
25974,An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek Latin and Hebrew THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS,2
25975,One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him saying If you are the Christ save yourself and us!,2
25976,But the other answered and rebuking him said Dont you even fear God seeing you are under the same condemnation,2
25977,And we indeed justly for we receive the due reward for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong,2
25978,He said to Jesus Lord remember me when you come into your Kingdom,2
25979,Jesus said to him Assuredly I tell you today you will be with me in Paradise,2
25980,It was now about the sixth hourTime was counted from sunrise so the sixth hour was about noon and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour300 PM,2
25981,The sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was torn in two,2
25982,Jesus crying with a loud voice said Father into your hands I commit my spirit! Having said this he breathed his last,2
25983,When the centurion saw what was done he glorified God saying Certainly this was a righteous man,2
25984,All the multitudes that came together to see this when they saw the things that were done returned home beating their breasts,2
25985,All his acquaintances and the women who followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things,2
25986,Behold a man named Joseph who was a member of the council a good and righteous man,2
25987,he had not consented to their counsel and deed from Arimathaea a city of the Jews who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God,2
25988,this man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus body,2
25989,He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone where no one had ever been laid,2
25990,It was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath was drawing near,2
25991,The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after and saw the tomb and how his body was laid,2
25992,They returned and prepared spices and ointments On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment,2
25993,But on the first day of the week at early dawn they and some others came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared,2
25994,They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,2
25995,They entered in and didnt find the Lord Jesus body,2
25996,It happened while they were greatly perplexed about this behold two men stood by them in dazzling clothing,2
25997,Becoming terrified they bowed their faces down to the earth They said to them Why do you seek the living among the dead,2
25998,He isnt here but is risen Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,2
25999,saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again,2
26000,They remembered his words,2
26001,returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest,2
26002,Now they were Mary Magdalene Joanna and Mary the mother of James The other women with them told these things to the apostles,2
26003,These words seemed to them to be nonsense and they didnt believe them,2
26004,But Peter got up and ran to the tomb Stooping and looking in he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves and he departed to his home wondering what had happened,2
26005,Behold two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus which was sixty stadia60 stadia  about 11 kilometers or about 7 miles from Jerusalem,2
26006,They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened,2
26007,It happened while they talked and questioned together that Jesus himself came near and went with them,2
26008,But their eyes were kept from recognizing him,2
26009,He said to them What are you talking about as you walk and are sad,2
26010,One of them named Cleopas answered him Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesnt know the things which have happened there in these days,2
26011,He said to them What things They said to him The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,2
26012,and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him,2
26013,But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel Yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things happened,2
26014,Also certain women of our company amazed us having arrived early at the tomb,2
26015,and when they didnt find his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive,2
26016,Some of us went to the tomb and found it just like the women had said but they didnt see him,2
26017,He said to them Foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!,2
26018,Didnt the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory,2
26019,Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself,2
26020,They drew near to the village where they were going and he acted like he would go further,2
26021,They urged him saying Stay with us for it is almost evening and the day is almost over He went in to stay with them,2
26022,It happened that when he had sat down at the table with them he took the bread and gave thanks Breaking it he gave to them,2
26023,Their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished out of their sight,2
26024,They said one to another Werent our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us along the way and while he opened the Scriptures to us,2
26025,They rose up that very hour returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them,2
26026,saying The Lord is risen indeed and has appeared to Simon!,2
26027,They related the things that happened along the way and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread,2
26028,As they said these things Jesus himself stood among them and said to them Peace be to you,2
26029,But they were terrified and filled with fear and supposed that they had seen a spirit,2
26030,He said to them Why are you troubled Why do doubts arise in your hearts,2
26031,See my hands and my feet that it is truly me Touch me and see for a spirit doesnt have flesh and bones as you see that I have,2
26032,When he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet,2
26033,While they still didnt believe for joy and wondered he said to them Do you have anything here to eat,2
26034,They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb,2
26035,He took them and ate in front of them,2
26036,He said to them This is what I told you while I was still with you that all things which are written in the law of Moses the prophets and the psalms concerning me must be fulfilled,2
26037,Then he opened their minds that they might understand the Scriptures,2
26038,He said to them Thus it is written and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,2
26039,and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem,2
26040,You are witnesses of these things,2
26041,Behold I send forth the promise of my Father on you But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high,2
26042,He led them out as far as Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them,2
26043,It happened while he blessed them that he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven,2
26044,They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,2
26045,and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God Amen,2
26046,In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God,3
26047,The same was in the beginning with God,3
26048,All things were made through him Without him was not anything made that has been made,3
26049,In him was life and the life was the light of men,3
26050,The light shines in the darkness and the darkness hasnt overcomeThe word translated overcome katelaben can also be translated comprehended It refers to getting a grip on an enemy to defeat him it,3
26051,There came a man sent from God whose name was John,3
26052,The same came as a witness that he might testify about the light that all might believe through him,3
26053,He was not the light but was sent that he might testify about the light,3
26054,The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world,3
26055,He was in the world and the world was made through him and the world didnt recognize him,3
26056,He came to his own and those who were his own didnt receive him,3
26057,But as many as received him to them he gave the right to become Gods children to those who believe in his name,3
26058,who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God,3
26059,The Word became flesh and lived among us We saw his glory such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father full of grace and truth,3
26060,John testified about him He cried out saying This was he of whom I said He who comes after me has surpassed me for he was before me,3
26061,From his fullness we all received grace upon grace,3
26062,For the law was given through Moses Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ,3
26063,No one has seen God at any time The one and only Son who is in the bosom of the Father he has declared him,3
26064,This is Johns testimony when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him Who are you,3
26065,He confessed and didnt deny but he confessed I am not the Christ,3
26066,They asked him What then Are you Elijah He said I am not Are you the Prophet He answered No,3
26067,They said therefore to him Who are you Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us What do you say about yourself,3
26068,He said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness Make straight the way of the Lord as Isaiah the prophet said,3
26069,The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees,3
26070,They asked him Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet,3
26071,John answered them I baptize in water but among you stands one whom you dont know,3
26072,He is the one who comes after me who is preferred before me whose sandal strap Im not worthy to loosen,3
26073,These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan where John was baptizing,3
26074,The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!,3
26075,This is he of whom I said After me comes a man who is preferred before me for he was before me,3
26076,I didnt know him but for this reason I came baptizing in water that he would be revealed to Israel,3
26077,John testified saying I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven and it remained on him,3
26078,I didnt recognize him but he who sent me to baptize in water he said to me On whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit,3
26079,I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God,3
26080,Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,3
26081,and he looked at Jesus as he walked and said Behold the Lamb of God!,3
26082,The two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus,3
26083,Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them What are you looking for They said to him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Teacher where are you staying,3
26084,He said to them Come and see They came and saw where he was staying and they stayed with him that day It was about the tenth hour400 PM,3
26085,One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew Simon Peters brother,3
26086,He first found his own brother Simon and said to him We have found the Messiah! which is being interpreted ChristMessiah Hebrew and Christ Greek both mean Anointed One,3
26087,He brought him to Jesus Jesus looked at him and said You are Simon the son of Jonah You shall be called Cephas which is by interpretation Peter,3
26088,On the next day he was determined to go out into Galilee and he found Philip Jesus said to him Follow me,3
26089,Now Philip was from Bethsaida of the city of Andrew and Peter,3
26090,Philip found Nathanael and said to him We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph,3
26091,Nathanael said to him Can any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip said to him Come and see,3
26092,Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said about him Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no deceit!,3
26093,Nathanael said to him How do you know me Jesus answered him Before Philip called you when you were under the fig tree I saw you,3
26094,Nathanael answered him Rabbi you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!,3
26095,Jesus answered him Because I told you I saw you underneath the fig tree do you believe You will see greater things than these!,3
26096,He said to him Most assuredly I tell you hereafter you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man,3
26097,The third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee Jesus mother was there,3
26098,Jesus also was invited with his disciples to the marriage,3
26099,When the wine ran out Jesus mother said to him They have no wine,3
26100,Jesus said to her Woman what does that have to do with you and me My hour has not yet come,3
26101,His mother said to the servants Whatever he says to you do it,3
26102,Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews manner of purifying containing two or three metretes2 to 3 metretes is about 20 to 30 U S Gallons 16 to 25 imperial gallons or 75 to 115 litres apiece,3
26103,Jesus said to them Fill the water pots with water They filled them up to the brim,3
26104,He said to them Now draw some out and take it to the ruler of the feast So they took it,3
26105,When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine and didnt know where it came from but the servants who had drawn the water knew the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,3
26106,and said to him Everyone serves the good wine first and when the guests have drunk freely then that which is worse You have kept the good wine until now!,3
26107,This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him,3
26108,After this he went down to Capernaum he and his mother his brothers and his disciples and they stayed there a few days,3
26109,The Passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,3
26110,He found in the temple those who sold oxen sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting,3
26111,He made a whip of cords and threw all out of the temple both the sheep and the oxen and he poured out the changers money and overthrew their tables,3
26112,To those who sold the doves he said Take these things out of here! Dont make my Fathers house a marketplace!,3
26113,His disciples remembered that it was written Zeal for your house will eat me up,3
26114,The Jews therefore answered him What sign do you show us seeing that you do these things,3
26115,Jesus answered them Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,3
26116,The Jews therefore said Fortysix years was this temple in building and will you raise it up in three days,3
26117,But he spoke of the temple of his body,3
26118,When therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he said this and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said,3
26119,Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed in his name observing his signs which he did,3
26120,But Jesus didnt trust himself to them because he knew everyone,3
26121,and because he didnt need for anyone to testify concerning man for he himself knew what was in man,3
26122,Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews,3
26123,The same came to him by night and said to him Rabbi we know that you are a teacher come from God for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him,3
26124,Jesus answered him Most assuredly I tell you unless one is born anewThe word translated anew here and in John 37 anothen also means again and from above he cant see the Kingdom of God,3
26125,Nicodemus said to him How can a man be born when he is old Can he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born,3
26126,Jesus answered Most assuredly I tell you unless one is born of water and spirit he cant enter into the Kingdom of God!,3
26127,That which is born of the flesh is flesh That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,3
26128,Dont marvel that I said to you You must be born anew,3
26129,The windThe same Greek word pneuma means wind breath and spirit blows where it wants to and you hear its sound but dont know where it comes from and where it is going So is everyone who is born of the Spirit,3
26130,Nicodemus answered him How can these things be,3
26131,Jesus answered him Are you the teacher of Israel and dont understand these things,3
26132,Most assuredly I tell you we speak that which we know and testify of that which we have seen and you dont receive our witness,3
26133,If I told you earthly things and you dont believe how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things,3
26134,No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended out of heaven the Son of Man who is in heaven,3
26135,As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,3
26136,that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life,3
26137,For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life,3
26138,For God didnt send his Son into the world to judge the world but that the world should be saved through him,3
26139,He who believes in him is not judged He who doesnt believe has been judged already because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God,3
26140,This is the judgment that the light has come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were evil,3
26141,For everyone who does evil hates the light and doesnt come to the light lest his works would be exposed,3
26142,But he who does the truth comes to the light that his works may be revealed that they have been done in God,3
26143,After these things Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea He stayed there with them and baptized,3
26144,John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim because there was much water there They came and were baptized,3
26145,For John was not yet thrown into prison,3
26146,There arose therefore a questioning on the part of Johns disciples with some Jews about purification,3
26147,They came to John and said to him Rabbi he who was with you beyond the Jordan to whom you have testified behold the same baptizes and everyone is coming to him,3
26148,John answered A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven,3
26149,You yourselves testify that I said I am not the Christ but I have been sent before him,3
26150,He who has the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice This my joy therefore is made full,3
26151,He must increase but I must decrease,3
26152,He who comes from above is above all He who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth and speaks of the Earth He who comes from heaven is above all,3
26153,What he has seen and heard of that he testifies and no one receives his witness,3
26154,He who has received his witness has set his seal to this that God is true,3
26155,For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God for God gives the Spirit without measure,3
26156,The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand,3
26157,One who believes in the Son has eternal life but one who disobeysThe same word can be translated disobeys or disbelieves in this context the Son wont see life but the wrath of God remains on him,3
26158,Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John,3
26159,although Jesus himself didnt baptize but his disciples,3
26160,he left Judea and departed into Galilee,3
26161,He needed to pass through Samaria,3
26162,So he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph,3
26163,Jacobs well was there Jesus therefore being tired from his journey sat down by the well It was about the sixth hournoon,3
26164,A woman of Samaria came to draw water Jesus said to her Give me a drink,3
26165,For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food,3
26166,The Samaritan woman therefore said to him How is it that you being a Jew ask for a drink from me a Samaritan woman For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans,3
26167,Jesus answered her If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you Give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water,3
26168,The woman said to him Sir you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep From where then have you that living water,3
26169,Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank of it himself as did his children and his cattle,3
26170,Jesus answered her Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,3
26171,but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life,3
26172,The woman said to him Sir give me this water so that I dont get thirsty neither come all the way here to draw,3
26173,Jesus said to her Go call your husband and come here,3
26174,The woman answered I have no husband Jesus said to her You said well I have no husband,3
26175,for you have had five husbands and he whom you now have is not your husband This you have said truly,3
26176,The woman said to him Sir I perceive that you are a prophet,3
26177,Our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship,3
26178,Jesus said to her Woman believe me the hour comes when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father,3
26179,You worship that which you dont know We worship that which we know for salvation is from the Jews,3
26180,But the hour comes and now is when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers,3
26181,God is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth,3
26182,The woman said to him I know that Messiah comes he who is called Christ When he has come he will declare to us all things,3
26183,Jesus said to her I am he the one who speaks to you,3
26184,At this his disciples came They marveled that he was speaking with a woman yet no one said What are you looking for or Why do you speak with her,3
26185,So the woman left her water pot and went away into the city and said to the people,3
26186,Come see a man who told me everything that I did Can this be the Christ,3
26187,They went out of the city and were coming to him,3
26188,In the meanwhile the disciples urged him saying Rabbi eat,3
26189,But he said to them I have food to eat that you dont know about,3
26190,The disciples therefore said one to another Has anyone brought him something to eat,3
26191,Jesus said to them My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work,3
26192,Dont you say There are yet four months until the harvest Behold I tell you lift up your eyes and look at the fields that they are white for harvest already,3
26193,He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to eternal life that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together,3
26194,For in this the saying is true One sows and another reaps,3
26195,I sent you to reap that for which you havent labored Others have labored and you have entered into their labor,3
26196,From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified He told me everything that I did,3
26197,So when the Samaritans came to him they begged him to stay with them He stayed there two days,3
26198,Many more believed because of his word,3
26199,They said to the woman Now we believe not because of your speaking for we have heard for ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the Savior of the world,3
26200,After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee,3
26201,For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country,3
26202,So when he came into Galilee the Galileans received him having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast for they also went to the feast,3
26203,Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee where he made the water into wine There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum,3
26204,When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee he went to him and begged him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death,3
26205,Jesus therefore said to him Unless you see signs and wonders you will in no way believe,3
26206,The nobleman said to him Sir come down before my child dies,3
26207,Jesus said to him Go your way Your son lives The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and he went his way,3
26208,As he was now going down his servants met him and reported saying Your child lives!,3
26209,So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better They said therefore to him Yesterday at the seventh hour100 P M the fever left him,3
26210,So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him Your son lives He believed as did his whole house,3
26211,This is again the second sign that Jesus did having come out of Judea into Galilee,3
26212,After these things there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,3
26213,Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate there is a pool which is called in Hebrew Bethesda having five porches,3
26214,In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick blind lame or paralyzed waiting for the moving of the water,3
26215,for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool and stirred up the water Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had,3
26216,A certain man was there who had been sick for thirtyeight years,3
26217,When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been sick for a long time he asked him Do you want to be made well,3
26218,The sick man answered him Sir I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up but while Im coming another steps down before me,3
26219,Jesus said to him Arise take up your mat and walk,3
26220,Immediately the man was made well and took up his mat and walked Now it was the Sabbath on that day,3
26221,So the Jews said to him who was cured It is the Sabbath It is not lawful for you to carry the mat,3
26222,He answered them He who made me well the same said to me Take up your mat and walk,3
26223,Then they asked him Who is the man who said to you Take up your mat and walk,3
26224,But he who was healed didnt know who it was for Jesus had withdrawn a crowd being in the place,3
26225,Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him Behold you are made well Sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you,3
26226,The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well,3
26227,For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill him because he did these things on the Sabbath,3
26228,But Jesus answered them My Father is still working so I am working too,3
26229,For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him because he not only broke the Sabbath but also called God his own Father making himself equal with God,3
26230,Jesus therefore answered them Most assuredly I tell you the Son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the Father doing For whatever things he does these the Son also does likewise,3
26231,For the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all things that he himself does He will show him greater works than these that you may marvel,3
26232,For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires,3
26233,For the Father judges no one but he has given all judgment to the Son,3
26234,that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father He who doesnt honor the Son doesnt honor the Father who sent him,3
26235,Most assuredly I tell you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and doesnt come into judgment but has passed out of death into life,3
26236,Most assuredly I tell you the hour comes and now is when the dead will hear the Son of Gods voice and those who hear will live,3
26237,For as the Father has life in himself even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself,3
26238,He also gave him authority to execute judgment because he is a son of man,3
26239,Dont marvel at this for the hour comes in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,3
26240,and will come out those who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment,3
26241,I can of myself do nothing As I hear I judge and my judgment is righteous because I dont seek my own will but the will of my Father who sent me,3
26242,If I testify about myself my witness is not valid,3
26243,It is another who testifies about me I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true,3
26244,You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth,3
26245,But the testimony which I receive is not from man However I say these things that you may be saved,3
26246,He was the burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light,3
26247,But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish the very works that I do testify about me that the Father has sent me,3
26248,The Father himself who sent me has testified about me You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form,3
26249,You dont have his word living in you because you dont believe him whom he sent,3
26250,You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and these are they which testify about me,3
26251,Yet you will not come to me that you may have life,3
26252,I dont receive glory from men,3
26253,But I know you that you dont have Gods love in yourselves,3
26254,I have come in my Fathers name and you dont receive me If another comes in his own name you will receive him,3
26255,How can you believe who receive glory from one another and you dont seek the glory that comes from the only God,3
26256,Dont think that I will accuse you to the Father There is one who accuses you even Moses on whom you have set your hope,3
26257,For if you believed Moses you would believe me for he wrote about me,3
26258,But if you dont believe his writings how will you believe my words,3
26259,After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee which is also called the Sea of Tiberias,3
26260,A great multitude followed him because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick,3
26261,Jesus went up into the mountain and he sat there with his disciples,3
26262,Now the Passover the feast of the Jews was at hand,3
26263,Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him said to Philip Where are we to buy bread that these may eat,3
26264,This he said to test him for he himself knew what he would do,3
26265,Philip answered him Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them that everyone of them may receive a little,3
26266,One of his disciples Andrew Simon Peters brother said to him,3
26267,There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish but what are these among so many,3
26268,Jesus said Have the people sit down Now there was much grass in that place So the men sat down in number about five thousand,3
26269,Jesus took the loaves and having given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to those who were sitting down likewise also of the fish as much as they desired,3
26270,When they were filled he said to his disciples Gather up the broken pieces which are left over that nothing be lost,3
26271,So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten,3
26272,When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did they said This is truly the prophet who comes into the world,3
26273,Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king withdrew again to the mountain by himself,3
26274,When evening came his disciples went down to the sea,3
26275,and they entered into the boat and were going over the sea to Capernaum It was now dark and Jesus had not come to them,3
26276,The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing,3
26277,When therefore they had rowed about twentyfive or thirty stadia25 to 30 stadia is about 5 to 6 kilometers or about 3 to 4 miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat and they were afraid,3
26278,But he said to them I AM Dont be afraid,3
26279,They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going,3
26280,On the next day the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one in which his disciples had embarked and that Jesus hadnt entered with his disciples into the boat but his disciples had gone away alone,3
26281,However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks,3
26282,When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasnt there nor his disciples they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus,3
26283,When they found him on the other side of the sea they asked him Rabbi when did you come here,3
26284,Jesus answered them Most assuredly I tell you you seek me not because you saw signs but because you ate of the loaves and were filled,3
26285,Dont work for the food which perishes but for the food which remains to eternal life which the Son of Man will give to you For God the Father has sealed him,3
26286,They said therefore to him What must we do that we may work the works of God,3
26287,Jesus answered them This is the work of God that you believe in him whom he has sent,3
26288,They said therefore to him What then do you do for a sign that we may see and believe you What work do you do,3
26289,Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness As it is written He gave them bread out of heavenGreek and Hebrew use the same word for heaven the heavens the sky and the air to eat,3
26290,Jesus therefore said to them Most assuredly I tell you it wasnt Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven,3
26291,For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world,3
26292,They said therefore to him Lord always give us this bread,3
26293,Jesus said to them I am the bread of life He who comes to me will not be hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty,3
26294,But I told you that you have seen me and yet you dont believe,3
26295,All those who the Father gives me will come to me Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out,3
26296,For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me,3
26297,This is the will of my Father who sent me that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing but should raise him up at the last day,3
26298,This is the will of the one who sent me that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day,3
26299,The Jews therefore murmured concerning him because he said I am the bread which came down out of heaven,3
26300,They said Isnt this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know How then does he say I have come down out of heaven,3
26301,Therefore Jesus answered them Dont murmur among yourselves,3
26302,No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him and I will raise him up in the last day,3
26303,It is written in the prophets They will all be taught by God Therefore everyone who hears from the Father and has learned comes to me,3
26304,Not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God He has seen the Father,3
26305,Most assuredly I tell you he who believes in me has eternal life,3
26306,I am the bread of life,3
26307,Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died,3
26308,This is the bread which comes down out of heaven that anyone may eat of it and not die,3
26309,I am the living bread which came down out of heaven If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever Yes the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh,3
26310,The Jews therefore contended with one another saying How can this man give us his flesh to eat,3
26311,Jesus therefore said to them Most assuredly I tell you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you dont have life in yourselves,3
26312,He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day,3
26313,For my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed,3
26314,He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I in him,3
26315,As the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father so he who feeds on me he will also live because of me,3
26316,This is the bread which came down out of heaven not as our fathers ate the manna and died He who eats this bread will live forever,3
26317,These things he said in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum,3
26318,Therefore many of his disciples when they heard this said This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it,3
26319,But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this said to them Does this cause you to stumble,3
26320,Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before,3
26321,It is the spirit who gives life The flesh profits nothing The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life,3
26322,But there are some of you who dont believe For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didnt believe and who it was who would betray him,3
26323,He said For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me unless it is given to him by my Father,3
26324,At this many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him,3
26325,Jesus said therefore to the twelve You dont also want to go away do you,3
26326,Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom would we go You have the words of eternal life,3
26327,We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ the Son of the living God,3
26328,Jesus answered them Didnt I choose you the twelve and one of you is a devil,3
26329,Now he spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot for it was he who would betray him being one of the twelve,3
26330,After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee for he wouldnt walk in Judea because the Jews sought to kill him,3
26331,Now the feast of the Jews the Feast of Booths was at hand,3
26332,His brothers therefore said to him Depart from here and go into Judea that your disciples also may see your works which you do,3
26333,For no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly If you do these things reveal yourself to the world,3
26334,For even his brothers didnt believe in him,3
26335,Jesus therefore said to them My time has not yet come but your time is always ready,3
26336,The world cant hate you but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil,3
26337,You go up to the feast I am not yet going up to this feast because my time is not yet fulfilled,3
26338,Having said these things to them he stayed in Galilee,3
26339,But when his brothers had gone up to the feast then he also went up not publicly but as it were in secret,3
26340,The Jews therefore sought him at the feast and said Where is he,3
26341,There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him Some said He is a good man Others said Not so but he leads the multitude astray,3
26342,Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews,3
26343,But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught,3
26344,The Jews therefore marveled saying How does this man know letters having never been educated,3
26345,Jesus therefore answered them My teaching is not mine but his who sent me,3
26346,If anyone desires to do his will he will know about the teaching whether it is from God or if I am speaking from myself,3
26347,He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him,3
26348,Didnt Moses give you the law and yet none of you keeps the law Why do you seek to kill me,3
26349,The multitude answered You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you,3
26350,Jesus answered them I did one work and you all marvel because of it,3
26351,Moses has given you circumcision not that it is of Moses but of the fathers and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy,3
26352,If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken are you angry with me because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath,3
26353,Dont judge according to appearance but judge righteous judgment,3
26354,Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said Isnt this he whom they seek to kill,3
26355,Behold he speaks openly and they say nothing to him Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ,3
26356,However we know where this man comes from but when the Christ comes no one will know where he comes from,3
26357,Jesus therefore cried out in the temple teaching and saying You both know me and know where I am from I have not come of myself but he who sent me is true whom you dont know,3
26358,I know him because I am from him and he sent me,3
26359,They sought therefore to take him but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come,3
26360,But of the multitude many believed in him They said When the Christ comes he wont do more signs than those which this man has done will he,3
26361,The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him,3
26362,Then Jesus said I will be with you a little while longer then I go to him who sent me,3
26363,You will seek me and wont find me and where I am you cant come,3
26364,The Jews therefore said among themselves Where will this man go that we wont find him Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks,3
26365,What is this word that he said You will seek me and wont find me and where I am you cant come,3
26366,Now on the last and greatest day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out If anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink!,3
26367,He who believes in me as the Scripture has said from within him will flow rivers of living water,3
26368,But he said this about the Spirit which those believing in him were to receive For the Holy Spirit was not yet given because Jesus wasnt yet glorified,3
26369,Many of the multitude therefore when they heard these words said This is truly the prophet,3
26370,Others said This is the Christ But some said What does the Christ come out of Galilee,3
26371,Hasnt the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David and from Bethlehem the village where David was,3
26372,So there arose a division in the multitude because of him,3
26373,Some of them would have arrested him but no one laid hands on him,3
26374,The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees and they said to them Why didnt you bring him,3
26375,The officers answered No man ever spoke like this man!,3
26376,The Pharisees therefore answered them You arent also led astray are you,3
26377,Have any of the rulers believed in him or of the Pharisees,3
26378,But this multitude that doesnt know the law is accursed,3
26379,Nicodemus he who came to him by night being one of them said to them,3
26380,Does our law judge a man unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does,3
26381,They answered him Are you also from Galilee Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee,3
26382,Everyone went to his own house,3
26383,but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives,3
26384,Now very early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came to him He sat down and taught them,3
26385,The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery Having set her in the midst,3
26386,they told him Teacher we found this woman in adultery in the very act,3
26387,Now in our law Moses commanded us to stone such What then do you say about her,3
26388,They said this testing him that they might have something to accuse him of But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger,3
26389,But when they continued asking him he looked up and said to them He who is without sin among you let him throw the first stone at her,3
26390,Again he stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground,3
26391,They when they heard it being convicted by their conscience went out one by one beginning from the oldest even to the last Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was in the middle,3
26392,Jesus standing up saw her and said Woman where are your accusers Did no one condemn you,3
26393,She said No one Lord Jesus said Neither do I condemn you Go your way From now on sin no more,3
26394,Again therefore Jesus spoke to them saying I am the light of the world He who follows me will not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life,3
26395,The Pharisees therefore said to him You testify about yourself Your testimony is not valid,3
26396,Jesus answered them Even if I testify about myself my testimony is true for I know where I came from and where I am going but you dont know where I came from or where I am going,3
26397,You judge according to the flesh I judge no one,3
26398,Even if I do judge my judgment is true for I am not alone but I am with the Father who sent me,3
26399,Its also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid,3
26400,I am one who testifies about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me,3
26401,They said therefore to him Where is your Father Jesus answered You know neither me nor my Father If you knew me you would know my Father also,3
26402,Jesus spoke these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple Yet no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come,3
26403,Jesus said therefore again to them I am going away and you will seek me and you will die in your sins Where I go you cant come,3
26404,The Jews therefore said Will he kill himself that he says Where I am going you cant come,3
26405,He said to them You are from beneath I am from above You are of this world I am not of this world,3
26406,I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins,3
26407,They said therefore to him Who are you Jesus said to them Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning,3
26408,I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you However he who sent me is true and the things which I heard from him these I say to the world,3
26409,They didnt understand that he spoke to them about the Father,3
26410,Jesus therefore said to them When you have lifted up the Son of Man then you will know that I am he and I do nothing of myself but as my Father taught me I say these things,3
26411,He who sent me is with me The Father hasnt left me alone for I always do the things that are pleasing to him,3
26412,As he spoke these things many believed in him,3
26413,Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him If you remain in my word then you are truly my disciples,3
26414,You will know the truth and the truth will make you free,3
26415,They answered him We are Abrahams seed and have never been in bondage to anyone How do you say You will be made free,3
26416,Jesus answered them Most assuredly I tell you everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin,3
26417,A bondservant doesnt live in the house forever A son remains forever,3
26418,If therefore the Son makes you free you will be free indeed,3
26419,I know that you are Abrahams seed yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you,3
26420,I say the things which I have seen with my Father and you also do the things which you have seen with your father,3
26421,They answered him Our father is Abraham Jesus said to them If you were Abrahams children you would do the works of Abraham,3
26422,But now you seek to kill me a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God Abraham didnt do this,3
26423,You do the works of your father They said to him We were not born of sexual immorality We have one Father God,3
26424,Therefore Jesus said to them If God were your Father you would love me for I came out and have come from God For I havent come of myself but he sent me,3
26425,Why dont you understand my speech Because you cant hear my word,3
26426,You are of your Father the devil and you want to do the desires of your father He was a murderer from the beginning and doesnt stand in the truth because there is no truth in him When he speaks a lie he speaks on his own for he is a liar and the father of it,3
26427,But because I tell the truth you dont believe me,3
26428,Which of you convicts me of sin If I tell the truth why do you not believe me,3
26429,He who is of God hears the words of God For this cause you dont hear because you are not of God,3
26430,Then the Jews answered him Dont we say well that you are a Samaritan and have a demon,3
26431,Jesus answered I dont have a demon but I honor my Father and you dishonor me,3
26432,But I dont seek my own glory There is one who seeks and judges,3
26433,Most assuredly I tell you if a person keeps my word he will never see death,3
26434,Then the Jews said to him Now we know that you have a demon Abraham died and the prophets and you say If a man keeps my word he will never taste of death,3
26435,Are you greater than our father Abraham who died The prophets died Who do you make yourself out to be,3
26436,Jesus answered If I glorify myself my glory is nothing It is my Father who glorifies me of whom you say that he is our God,3
26437,You have not known him but I know him If I said I dont know him I would be like you a liar But I know him and keep his word,3
26438,Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day He saw it and was glad,3
26439,The Jews therefore said to him You are not yet fifty years old and have you seen Abraham,3
26440,Jesus said to them Most assuredly I tell you before Abraham came into existence I AM,3
26441,Therefore they took up stones to throw at him but Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple having gone through the midst of them and so passed by,3
26442,As he passed by he saw a man blind from birth,3
26443,His disciples asked him Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind,3
26444,Jesus answered Neither did this man sin nor his parents but that the works of God might be revealed in him,3
26445,I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day The night is coming when no one can work,3
26446,While I am in the world I am the light of the world,3
26447,When he had said this he spat on the ground made mud with the saliva anointed the blind mans eyes with the mud,3
26448,and said to him Go wash in the pool of Siloam which means Sent So he went away washed and came back seeing,3
26449,The neighbors therefore and those who saw that he was blind before said Isnt this he who sat and begged,3
26450,Others were saying It is he Still others were saying He looks like him He said I am he,3
26451,They therefore were asking him How were your eyes opened,3
26452,He answered A man called Jesus made mud anointed my eyes and said to me Go to the pool of Siloam and wash So I went away and washed and I received sight,3
26453,Then they asked him Where is he He said I dont know,3
26454,They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees,3
26455,It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes,3
26456,Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight He said to them He put mud on my eyes I washed and I see,3
26457,Some therefore of the Pharisees said This man is not from God because he doesnt keep the Sabbath Others said How can a man who is a sinner do such signs There was division among them,3
26458,Therefore they asked the blind man again What do you say about him because he opened your eyes He said He is a prophet,3
26459,The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,3
26460,and asked them Is this your son who you say was born blind How then does he now see,3
26461,His parents answered them We know that this is our son and that he was born blind,3
26462,but how he now sees we dont know or who opened his eyes we dont know He is of age Ask him He will speak for himself,3
26463,His parents said these things because they feared the Jews for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ he would be put out of the synagogue,3
26464,Therefore his parents said He is of age Ask him,3
26465,So they called the man who was blind a second time and said to him Give glory to God We know that this man is a sinner,3
26466,He therefore answered I dont know if he is a sinner One thing I do know that though I was blind now I see,3
26467,They said to him again What did he do to you How did he open your eyes,3
26468,He answered them I told you already and you didnt listen Why do you want to hear it again You dont also want to become his disciples do you,3
26469,They insulted him and said You are his disciple but we are disciples of Moses,3
26470,We know that God has spoken to Moses But as for this man we dont know where he comes from,3
26471,The man answered them How amazing! You dont know where he comes from yet he opened my eyes,3
26472,We know that God doesnt listen to sinners but if anyone is a worshipper of God and does his will he listens to him,3
26473,Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind,3
26474,If this man were not from God he could do nothing,3
26475,They answered him You were altogether born in sins and do you teach us They threw him out,3
26476,Jesus heard that they had thrown him out and finding him he said Do you believe in the Son of God,3
26477,He answered Who is he Lord that I may believe in him,3
26478,Jesus said to him You have both seen him and it is he who speaks with you,3
26479,He said Lord I believe! and he worshiped him,3
26480,Jesus said I came into this world for judgment that those who dont see may see and that those who see may become blind,3
26481,Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said to him Are we also blind,3
26482,Jesus said to them If you were blind you would have no sin but now you say We see Therefore your sin remains,3
26483,Most assuredly I tell you one who doesnt enter by the door into the sheep fold but climbs up some other way the same is a thief and a robber,3
26484,But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep,3
26485,The gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep listen to his voice He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out,3
26486,Whenever he brings out his own sheep he goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice,3
26487,They will by no means follow a stranger but will flee from him for they dont know the voice of strangers,3
26488,Jesus spoke this parable to them but they didnt understand what he was telling them,3
26489,Jesus therefore said to them again Most assuredly I tell you I am the sheeps door,3
26490,All who came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep didnt listen to them,3
26491,I am the door If anyone enters in by me he will be saved and will go in and go out and will find pasture,3
26492,The thief only comes to steal kill and destroy I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly,3
26493,I am the good shepherd The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep,3
26494,He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd who doesnt own the sheep sees the wolf coming leaves the sheep and flees The wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them,3
26495,The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand and doesnt care for the sheep,3
26496,I am the good shepherd I know my own and Im known by my own,3
26497,even as the Father knows me and I know the Father I lay down my life for the sheep,3
26498,I have other sheep which are not of this fold I must bring them also and they will hear my voice They will become one flock with one shepherd,3
26499,Therefore the Father loves me because I lay down my life that I may take it again,3
26500,No one takes it away from me but I lay it down by myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again I received this commandment from my Father,3
26501,Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words,3
26502,Many of them said He has a demon and is insane! Why do you listen to him,3
26503,Others said These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon It isnt possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind is it,3
26504,It was the Feast of the DedicationThe Feast of the Dedication is the Greek name for Chanukkah a celebration of the rededication of the Temple at Jerusalem,3
26505,It was winter and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomons porch,3
26506,The Jews therefore came around him and said to him How long will you hold us in suspense If you are the Christ tell us plainly,3
26507,Jesus answered them I told you and you dont believe The works that I do in my Fathers name these testify about me,3
26508,But you dont believe because you are not of my sheep as I told you,3
26509,My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me,3
26510,I give eternal life to them They will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand,3
26511,My Father who has given them to me is greater than all No one is able to snatch them out of my Fathers hand,3
26512,I and the Father are one,3
26513,Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him,3
26514,Jesus answered them I have shown you many good works from my Father For which of those works do you stone me,3
26515,The Jews answered him We dont stone you for a good work but for blasphemy because you being a man make yourself God,3
26516,Jesus answered them Isnt it written in your law I said you are gods,3
26517,If he called them gods to whom the word of God came and the Scripture cant be broken,3
26518,Do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world You blaspheme because I said I am the Son of God,3
26519,If I dont do the works of my Father dont believe me,3
26520,But if I do them though you dont believe me believe the works that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in the Father,3
26521,They sought again to seize him and he went out of their hand,3
26522,He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first and there he stayed,3
26523,Many came to him They said John indeed did no sign but everything that John said about this man is true,3
26524,Many believed in him there,3
26525,Now a certain man was sick Lazarus from Bethany of the village of Mary and her sister Martha,3
26526,It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick,3
26527,The sisters therefore sent to him saying Lord behold he for whom you have great affection is sick,3
26528,But when Jesus heard it he said This sickness is not to death but for the glory of God that Gods Son may be glorified by it,3
26529,Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus,3
26530,When therefore he heard that he was sick he stayed two days in the place where he was,3
26531,Then after this he said to the disciples Lets go into Judea again,3
26532,The disciples told him Rabbi the Jews were just trying to stone you and are you going there again,3
26533,Jesus answered Arent there twelve hours of daylight If a man walks in the day he doesnt stumble because he sees the light of this world,3
26534,But if a man walks in the night he stumbles because the light isnt in him,3
26535,He said these things and after that he said to them Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep,3
26536,The disciples therefore said Lord if he has fallen asleep he will recover,3
26537,Now Jesus had spoken of his death but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep,3
26538,So Jesus said to them plainly then Lazarus is dead,3
26539,I am glad for your sakes that I was not there so that you may believe Nevertheless lets go to him,3
26540,Thomas therefore who is called DidymusDidymus means Twin said to his fellow disciples Lets go also that we may die with him,3
26541,So when Jesus came he found that he had been in the tomb four days already,3
26542,Now Bethany was near Jerusalem about fifteen stadia15 stadia is about 28 kilometers or 17 miles away,3
26543,Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother,3
26544,Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went and met him but Mary stayed in the house,3
26545,Therefore Martha said to Jesus Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldnt have died,3
26546,Even now I know that whatever you ask of God God will give you,3
26547,Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again,3
26548,Martha said to him I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day,3
26549,Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life He who believes in me though he die yet will he live,3
26550,Whoever lives and believes in me will never die Do you believe this,3
26551,She said to him Yes Lord I have come to believe that you are the Christ Gods Son he who comes into the world,3
26552,When she had said this she went away and called Mary her sister secretly saying The Teacher is here and is calling you,3
26553,When she heard this she arose quickly and went to him,3
26554,Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was in the place where Martha met him,3
26555,Then the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her when they saw Mary that she rose up quickly and went out followed her saying She is going to the tomb to weep there,3
26556,Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying to him Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldnt have died,3
26557,When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews weeping who came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled,3
26558,and said Where have you laid him They told him Lord come and see,3
26559,Jesus wept,3
26560,The Jews therefore said See how much affection he had for him!,3
26561,Some of them said Couldnt this man who opened the eyes of him who was blind have also kept this man from dying,3
26562,Jesus therefore again groaning in himself came to the tomb Now it was a cave and a stone lay against it,3
26563,Jesus said Take away the stone Martha the sister of him who was dead said to him Lord by this time there is a stench for he has been dead four days,3
26564,Jesus said to her Didnt I tell you that if you believed you would see Gods glory,3
26565,So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying Jesus lifted up his eyes and said Father I thank you that you listened to me,3
26566,I know that you always listen to me but because of the multitude that stands around I said this that they may believe that you sent me,3
26567,When he had said this he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come out!,3
26568,He who was dead came out bound hand and foot with wrappings and his face was wrapped around with a cloth Jesus said to them Free him and let him go,3
26569,Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him,3
26570,But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done,3
26571,The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council and said What are we doing For this man does many signs,3
26572,If we leave him alone like this everyone will believe in him and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation,3
26573,But a certain one of them Caiaphas being high priest that year said to them You know nothing at all,3
26574,nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation not perish,3
26575,Now he didnt say this of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,3
26576,and not for the nation only but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad,3
26577,So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death,3
26578,Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews but departed from there into the country near the wilderness to a city called Ephraim He stayed there with his disciples,3
26579,Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves,3
26580,Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another as they stood in the temple What do you thinkthat he isnt coming to the feast at all,3
26581,Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was he should report it that they might seize him,3
26582,Then six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was who had been dead whom he raised from the dead,3
26583,So they made him a supper there Martha served but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him,3
26584,Mary therefore took a pounda Roman pound of 12 ounces or about 340 grams of ointment of pure nard very precious and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment,3
26585,Then Judas Iscariot Simons son one of his disciples who would betray him said,3
26586,Why wasnt this ointment sold for three hundred denarii300 denarii was about a years wages for an agricultural laborer and given to the poor,3
26587,Now he said this not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and having the money box used to steal what was put into it,3
26588,But Jesus said Leave her alone She has kept this for the day of my burial,3
26589,For you always have the poor with you but you dont always have me,3
26590,A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there and they came not for Jesus sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead,3
26591,But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,3
26592,because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus,3
26593,On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,3
26594,they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord the King of Israel!,3
26595,Jesus having found a young donkey sat on it As it is written,3
26596,Dont be afraid daughter of Zion Behold your King comes sitting on a donkeys colt,3
26597,His disciples didnt understand these things at first but when Jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things were written about him and that they had done these things to him,3
26598,The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead was testifying about it,3
26599,For this cause also the multitude went and met him because they heard that he had done this sign,3
26600,The Pharisees therefore said among themselves See how you accomplish nothing Behold the world has gone after him,3
26601,Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast,3
26602,These therefore came to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee and asked him saying Sir we want to see Jesus,3
26603,Philip came and told Andrew and in turn Andrew came with Philip and they told Jesus,3
26604,Jesus answered them The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified,3
26605,Most assuredly I tell you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains by itself alone But if it dies it bears much fruit,3
26606,He who loves his life will lose it He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life,3
26607,If anyone serves me let him follow me Where I am there will my servant also be If anyone serves me the Father will honor him,3
26608,Now my soul is troubled What shall I say Father save me from this time But for this cause I came to this time,3
26609,Father glorify your name! Then there came a voice out of the sky saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again,3
26610,The multitude therefore who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered Others said An angel has spoken to him,3
26611,Jesus answered This voice hasnt come for my sake but for your sakes,3
26612,Now is the judgment of this world Now the prince of this world will be cast out,3
26613,And I if I am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself,3
26614,But he said this signifying by what kind of death he should die,3
26615,The multitude answered him We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever How do you say The Son of Man must be lifted up Who is this Son of Man,3
26616,Jesus therefore said to them Yet a little while the light is with you Walk while you have the light that darkness doesnt overtake you He who walks in the darkness doesnt know where he is going,3
26617,While you have the light believe in the light that you may become children of light Jesus said these things and he departed and hid himself from them,3
26618,But though he had done so many signs before them yet they didnt believe in him,3
26619,that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spoke Lord who has believed our report To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed,3
26620,For this cause they couldnt believe for Isaiah said again,3
26621,He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart Lest they should see with their eyes And perceive with their heart And would turn And I would heal them,3
26622,Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke of him,3
26623,Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him but because of the Pharisees they didnt confess it so that they wouldnt be put out of the synagogue,3
26624,for they loved mens praise more than Gods praise,3
26625,Jesus cried out and said Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me,3
26626,He who sees me sees him who sent me,3
26627,I have come as a light into the world that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness,3
26628,If anyone listens to my sayings and doesnt believe I dont judge him For I came not to judge the world but to save the world,3
26629,He who rejects me and doesnt receive my sayings has one who judges him The word that I spoke the same will judge him in the last day,3
26630,For I spoke not from myself but the Father who sent me he gave me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak,3
26631,I know that his commandment is eternal life The things therefore which I speak even as the Father has said to me so I speak,3
26632,Now before the feast of the Passover Jesus knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,3
26633,After supper the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simons son to betray him,3
26634,Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he came forth from God and was going to God,3
26635,arose from supper and laid aside his outer garments He took a towel and wrapped a towel around his waist,3
26636,Then he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him,3
26637,Then he came to Simon Peter He said to him Lord do you wash my feet,3
26638,Jesus answered him You dont know what I am doing now but you will understand later,3
26639,Peter said to him You will never wash my feet! Jesus answered him If I dont wash you you have no part with me,3
26640,Simon Peter said to him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head!,3
26641,Jesus said to him Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed but is completely clean You are clean but not all of you,3
26642,For he knew him who would betray him therefore he said You are not all clean,3
26643,So when he had washed their feet put his outer garment back on and sat down again he said to them Do you know what I have done to you,3
26644,You call me Teacher and Lord You say so correctly for so I am,3
26645,If I then the Lord and the Teacher have washed your feet you also ought to wash one anothers feet,3
26646,For I have given you an example that you also should do as I have done to you,3
26647,Most assuredly I tell you a servant is not greater than his lord neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him,3
26648,If you know these things blessed are you if you do them,3
26649,I dont speak concerning all of you I know whom I have chosen But that the Scripture may be fulfilled He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me,3
26650,From now on I tell you before it happens that when it happens you may believe that I AM,3
26651,Most assuredly I tell you he who receives whomever I send receives me and he who receives me receives him who sent me,3
26652,When Jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit and testified Most assuredly I tell you that one of you will betray me,3
26653,The disciples looked at one another perplexed about whom he spoke,3
26654,One of his disciples whom Jesus loved was at the table leaning against Jesus breast,3
26655,Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him and said to him Tell us who it is of whom he speaks,3
26656,He leaning back as he was on Jesus breast asked him Lord who is it,3
26657,Jesus therefore answered It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it So when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot,3
26658,After the piece of bread then Satan entered into him Then Jesus said to him What you do do quickly,3
26659,Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him,3
26660,For some thought because Judas had the money box that Jesus said to him Buy what things we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor,3
26661,Therefore having received that morsel he went out immediately It was night,3
26662,When he had gone out Jesus said Now the Son of Man has been glorified and God has been glorified in him,3
26663,If God has been glorified in him God will also glorify him in himself and he will glorify him immediately,3
26664,Little children I will be with you a little while longer You will seek me and as I said to the Jews Where I am going you cant come so now I tell you,3
26665,A new commandment I give to you that you love one another just like I have loved you that you also love one another,3
26666,By this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another,3
26667,Simon Peter said to him Lord where are you going Jesus answered Where I am going you cant follow now but you will follow afterwards,3
26668,Peter said to him Lord why cant I follow you now I will lay down my life for you,3
26669,Jesus answered him Will you lay down your life for me Most assuredly I tell you the rooster wont crow until you have denied me three times,3
26670,Dont let your heart be troubled Believe in God Believe also in me,3
26671,In my Fathers house are many mansions If it werent so I would have told you I am going to prepare a place for you,3
26672,If I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and will receive you to myself that where I am you may be there also,3
26673,Where I go you know and you know the way,3
26674,Thomas says to him Lord we dont know where you are going How can we know the way,3
26675,Jesus said to him I am the way the truth and the life No one comes to the Father except through me,3
26676,If you had known me you would have known my Father also From now on you know him and have seen him,3
26677,Philip said to him Lord show us the Father and that will be enough for us,3
26678,Jesus said to him Have I been with you such a long time and do you not know me Philip He who has seen me has seen the Father How do you say Show us the Father,3
26679,Dont you believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me The words that I tell you I speak not from myself but the Father who lives in me does his works,3
26680,Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me or else believe me for the very works sake,3
26681,Most assuredly I tell you he who believes in me the works that I do he will do also and greater works than these will he do because I am going to my Father,3
26682,Whatever you will ask in my name that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son,3
26683,If you will ask anything in my name I will do it,3
26684,If you love me keep my commandments,3
26685,I will pray to the Father and he will give you another CounselorGreek Parakleton Counselor Helper Intercessor Advocate and Comfortor that he may be with you forever,3
26686,the Spirit of truth whom the world cant receive for it doesnt see him neither knows him You know him for he lives with you and will be in you,3
26687,I will not leave you orphans I will come to you,3
26688,Yet a little while and the world will see me no more but you will see me Because I live you will live also,3
26689,In that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you,3
26690,One who has my commandments and keeps them that person is one who loves me One who loves me will be loved by my Father and I will love him and will reveal myself to him,3
26691,Judas not Iscariot said to him Lord what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us and not to the world,3
26692,Jesus answered him If a man loves me he will keep my word My Father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him,3
26693,He who doesnt love me doesnt keep my words The word which you hear isnt mine but the Fathers who sent me,3
26694,I have said these things to you while still living with you,3
26695,But the Counselor the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name he will teach you all things and will remind you of all that I said to you,3
26696,Peace I leave with you My peace I give to you not as the world gives give I to you Dont let your heart be troubled neither let it be fearful,3
26697,You heard how I told you I go away and I come to you If you loved me you would have rejoiced because I said I am going to my Father for the Father is greater than I,3
26698,Now I have told you before it happens so that when it happens you may believe,3
26699,I will no more speak much with you for the prince of the world comes and he has nothing in me,3
26700,But that the world may know that I love the Father and as the Father commanded me even so I do Arise let us go from here,3
26701,I am the true vine and my Father is the farmer,3
26702,Every branch in me that doesnt bear fruit he takes away Every branch that bears fruit he prunes that it may bear more fruit,3
26703,You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you,3
26704,Remain in me and I in you As the branch cant bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine so neither can you unless you remain in me,3
26705,I am the vine You are the branches He who remains in me and I in him the same bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing,3
26706,If a man doesnt remain in me he is thrown out as a branch and is withered and they gather them throw them into the fire and they are burned,3
26707,If you remain in me and my words remain in you you will ask whatever you desire and it will be done for you,3
26708,In this is my Father glorified that you bear much fruit and so you will be my disciples,3
26709,Even as the Father has loved me I also have loved you Remain in my love,3
26710,If you keep my commandments you will remain in my love even as I have kept my Fathers commandments and remain in his love,3
26711,I have spoken these things to you that my joy may remain in you and that your joy may be made full,3
26712,This is my commandment that you love one another even as I have loved you,3
26713,Greater love has no one than this that someone lay down his life for his friends,3
26714,You are my friends if you do whatever I command you,3
26715,No longer do I call you servants for the servant doesnt know what his lord does But I have called you friends for everything that I heard from my Father I have made known to you,3
26716,You didnt choose me but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name he may give it to you,3
26717,I command these things to you that you may love one another,3
26718,If the world hates you you know that it has hated me before it hated you,3
26719,If you were of the world the world would love its own But because you are not of the world since I chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you,3
26720,Remember the word that I said to you A servant is not greater than his lord If they persecuted me they will also persecute you If they kept my word they will keep yours also,3
26721,But all these things will they do to you for my names sake because they dont know him who sent me,3
26722,If I had not come and spoken to them they would not have had sin but now they have no excuse for their sin,3
26723,He who hates me hates my Father also,3
26724,If I hadnt done among them the works which no one else did they wouldnt have had sin But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father,3
26725,But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law They hated me without a cause,3
26726,When the CounselorGreek Parakletos Counselor Helper Advocate Intercessor and Comfortor has come whom I will send to you from the Father the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father he will testify about me,3
26727,You will also testify because you have been with me from the beginning,3
26728,These things have I spoken to you so that you wouldnt be caused to stumble,3
26729,They will put you out of the synagogues Yes the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God,3
26730,They will do these thingsTR adds to you because they have not known the Father nor me,3
26731,But I have told you these things so that when the time comes you may remember that I told you about them I didnt tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you,3
26732,But now I am going to him who sent me and none of you asks me Where are you going,3
26733,But because I have told you these things sorrow has filled your heart,3
26734,Nevertheless I tell you the truth It is to your advantage that I go away for if I dont go away the Counselor wont come to you But if I go I will send him to you,3
26735,When he has come he will convict the world about sin about righteousness and about judgment,3
26736,about sin because they dont believe in me,3
26737,about righteousness because I am going to my Father and you wont see me any more,3
26738,about judgment because the prince of this world has been judged,3
26739,I have yet many things to tell you but you cant bear them now,3
26740,However when he the Spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he will not speak from himself but whatever he hears he will speak He will declare to you things that are coming,3
26741,He will glorify me for he will take from what is mine and will declare it to you,3
26742,All things whatever the Father has are mine therefore I said that he takesTR reads will take instead of takes of mine and will declare it to you,3
26743,A little while and you will not see me Again a little while and you will see me,3
26744,Some of his disciples therefore said to one another What is this that he says to us A little while and you wont see me and again a little while and you will see me and Because I go to the Father,3
26745,They said therefore What is this that he says A little while We dont know what he is saying,3
26746,Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him and he said to them Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this that I said A little while and you wont see me and again a little while and you will see me,3
26747,Most assuredly I tell you that you will weep and lament but the world will rejoice You will be sorrowful but your sorrow will be turned into joy,3
26748,A woman when she gives birth has sorrow because her time has come But when she has delivered the child she doesnt remember the anguish any more for the joy that a human being is born into the world,3
26749,Therefore you now have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice and no one will take your joy away from you,3
26750,In that day you will ask me no questions Most assuredly I tell you whatever you may ask of the Father in my name he will give it to you,3
26751,Until now you have asked nothing in my name Ask and you will receive that your joy may be made full,3
26752,I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father,3
26753,In that day you will ask in my name and I dont say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,3
26754,for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God,3
26755,I came out from the Father and have come into the world Again I leave the world and go to the Father,3
26756,His disciples said to him Behold now you speak plainly and speak no figures of speech,3
26757,Now we know that you know all things and dont need for anyone to question you By this we believe that you came forth from God,3
26758,Jesus answered them Do you now believe,3
26759,Behold the time is coming yes and has now come that you will be scattered everyone to his own place and you will leave me alone Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me,3
26760,I have told you these things that in me you may have peace In the world you have oppression but cheer up! I have overcome the world,3
26761,Jesus said these things and lifting up his eyes to heaven he said Father the time has come Glorify your Son that your Son may also glorify you,3
26762,even as you gave him authority over all flesh he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him,3
26763,This is eternal life that they should know you the only true God and him whom you sent Jesus Christ,3
26764,I glorified you on the earth I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do,3
26765,Now Father glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed,3
26766,I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world They were yours and you have given them to me They have kept your word,3
26767,Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,3
26768,for the words which you have given me I have given to them and they received them and knew for sure that I came forth from you and they have believed that you sent me,3
26769,I pray for them I dont pray for the world but for those whom you have given me for they are yours,3
26770,All things that are mine are yours and yours are mine and I am glorified in them,3
26771,I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I am coming to you Holy Father keep them through your name which you have given me that they may be one even as we are,3
26772,While I was with them in the world I kept them in your name Those whom you have given me I have kept None of them is lost except the son of destruction that the Scripture might be fulfilled,3
26773,But now I come to you and I say these things in the world that they may have my joy made full in themselves,3
26774,I have given them your word The world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world,3
26775,I pray not that you would take them from the world but that you would keep them from the evil one,3
26776,They are not of the world even as I am not of the world,3
26777,Sanctify them in your truth Your word is truth,3
26778,As you sent me into the world even so I have sent them into the world,3
26779,For their sakes I sanctify myself that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth,3
26780,Not for these only do I pray but for those also who believe in me through their word,3
26781,that they may all be one even as you Father are in me and I in you that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that you sent me,3
26782,The glory which you have given me I have given to them that they may be one even as we are one,3
26783,I in them and you in me that they may be perfected into one that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me,3
26784,Father I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am that they may see my glory which you have given me for you loved me before the foundation of the world,3
26785,Righteous Father the world hasnt known you but I knew you and these knew that you sent me,3
26786,I made known to them your name and will make it known that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in them,3
26787,When Jesus had spoken these words he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron where was a garden into which he and his disciples entered,3
26788,Now Judas who betrayed him also knew the place for Jesus often resorted there with his disciples,3
26789,Judas then having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees came there with lanterns torches and weapons,3
26790,Jesus therefore knowing all the things that were happening to him went forth and said to them Who are you looking for,3
26791,They answered him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus said to them I AM Judas also who betrayed him was standing with them,3
26792,When therefore he said to them I AM they went backward and fell to the ground,3
26793,Again therefore he asked them Who are you looking for They said Jesus of Nazareth,3
26794,Jesus answered I told you that I AM If therefore you seek me let these go their way,3
26795,that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke Of those whom you have given me I have lost none,3
26796,Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it and struck the high priests servant and cut off his right ear The servants name was Malchus,3
26797,Jesus therefore said to Peter Put the sword into its sheath The cup which the Father has given me shall I not surely drink it,3
26798,So the detachment the commanding officer and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him,3
26799,and led him to Annas first for he was fatherinlaw to Caiaphas who was high priest that year,3
26800,Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people,3
26801,Simon Peter followed Jesus as did another disciple Now that disciple was known to the high priest and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest,3
26802,but Peter was standing at the door outside So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to her who kept the door and brought in Peter,3
26803,Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter Are you also one of this mans disciples He said I am not,3
26804,Now the servants and the officers were standing there having made a fire of coals for it was cold They were warming themselves Peter was with them standing and warming himself,3
26805,The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching,3
26806,Jesus answered him I spoke openly to the world I always taught in synagogues and in the temple where the Jews always meet I said nothing in secret,3
26807,Why do you ask me Ask those who have heard me what I said to them Behold these know the things which I said,3
26808,When he had said this one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand saying Do you answer the high priest like that,3
26809,Jesus answered him If I have spoken evil testify of the evil but if well why do you beat me,3
26810,Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest,3
26811,Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself They said therefore to him You arent also one of his disciples are you He denied it and said I am not,3
26812,One of the servants of the high priest being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off said Didnt I see you in the garden with him,3
26813,Peter therefore denied it again and immediately the rooster crowed,3
26814,They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium It was early and they themselves didnt enter into the Praetorium that they might not be defiled but might eat the Passover,3
26815,Pilate therefore went out to them and said What accusation do you bring against this man,3
26816,They answered him If this man werent an evildoer we wouldnt have delivered him up to you,3
26817,Pilate therefore said to them Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law Therefore the Jews said to him It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,3
26818,that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke signifying by what kind of death he should die,3
26819,Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium called Jesus and said to him Are you the King of the Jews,3
26820,Jesus answered him Do you say this by yourself or did others tell you about me,3
26821,Pilate answered Im not a Jew am I Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me What have you done,3
26822,Jesus answered My Kingdom is not of this world If my Kingdom were of this world then my servants would fight that I wouldnt be delivered to the Jews But now my Kingdom is not from here,3
26823,Pilate therefore said to him Are you a king then Jesus answered You say that I am a king For this reason I have been born and for this reason I have come into the world that I should testify to the truth Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice,3
26824,Pilate said to him What is truth When he had said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them I find no basis for a charge against him,3
26825,But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews,3
26826,Then they all shouted again saying Not this man but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber,3
26827,So Pilate then took Jesus and flogged him,3
26828,The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown and put it on his head and dressed him in a purple garment,3
26829,They kept saying Hail King of the Jews! and they kept slapping him,3
26830,Then Pilate went out again and said to them Behold I bring him out to you that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him,3
26831,Jesus therefore came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment Pilate said to them Behold the man!,3
26832,When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they shouted saying Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them Take him yourselves and crucify him for I find no basis for a charge against him,3
26833,The Jews answered him We have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God,3
26834,When therefore Pilate heard this saying he was more afraid,3
26835,He entered into the Praetorium again and said to Jesus Where are you from But Jesus gave him no answer,3
26836,Pilate therefore said to him Arent you speaking to me Dont you know that I have power to release you and have power to crucify you,3
26837,Jesus answered You would have no power at all against me unless it were given to you from above Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin,3
26838,At this Pilate was seeking to release him but the Jews cried out saying If you release this man you arent Caesars friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!,3
26839,When Pilate therefore heard these words he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement but in Hebrew Gabbatha,3
26840,Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover at about the sixth hournoon He said to the Jews Behold your King!,3
26841,They cried out Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! Pilate said to them Shall I crucify your King The chief priests answered We have no king but Caesar!,3
26842,So then he delivered him to them to be crucified So they took Jesus and led him away,3
26843,He went out bearing his cross to the place called The Place of a Skull which is called in Hebrew Golgotha,3
26844,where they crucified him and with him two others on either side one and Jesus in the middle,3
26845,Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross There was written JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS,3
26846,Therefore many of the Jews read this title for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in Hebrew in Latin and in Greek,3
26847,The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate Dont write The King of the Jews but he said I am King of the Jews,3
26848,Pilate answered What I have written I have written,3
26849,Then the soldiers when they had crucified Jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also the coat Now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout,3
26850,Then they said to one another Lets not tear it but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says They parted my garments among them For my cloak they cast lots Therefore the soldiers did these things,3
26851,But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mothers sister Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene,3
26852,Therefore when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there he said to his mother Woman behold your son!,3
26853,Then he said to the disciple Behold your mother! From that hour the disciple took her to his own home,3
26854,After this Jesus seeingNU TR read knowing instead of seeing that all things were now finished that the Scripture might be fulfilled said I am thirsty,3
26855,Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it at his mouth,3
26856,When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said It is finished He bowed his head and gave up his spirit,3
26857,Therefore the Jews because it was the Preparation Day so that the bodies wouldnt remain on the cross on the Sabbath for that Sabbath was a special one asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away,3
26858,Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him,3
26859,but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead they didnt break his legs,3
26860,However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out,3
26861,He who has seen has testified and his testimony is true He knows that he tells the truth that you may believe,3
26862,For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled A bone of him will not be broken,3
26863,Again another Scripture says They will look on him whom they pierced,3
26864,After these things Joseph of Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus body Pilate gave him permission He came therefore and took away his body,3
26865,Nicodemus who at first came to Jesus by night also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pounds100 Roman pounds of 12 ounces each or about 72 pounds or 33 Kilograms,3
26866,So they took Jesus body and bound it in linen cloths with the spices as the custom of the Jews is to bury,3
26867,Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden In the garden a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid,3
26868,Then because of the Jews Preparation Day for the tomb was near at hand they laid Jesus there,3
26869,Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went early while it was still dark to the tomb and saw the stone taken away from the tomb,3
26870,Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb and we dont know where they have laid him!,3
26871,Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out and they went toward the tomb,3
26872,They both ran together The other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first,3
26873,Stooping and looking in he saw the linen cloths lying yet he didnt enter in,3
26874,Then Simon Peter came following him and entered into the tomb He saw the linen cloths lying,3
26875,and the cloth that had been on his head not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself,3
26876,So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in and he saw and believed,3
26877,For as yet they didnt know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead,3
26878,So the disciples went away again to their own homes,3
26879,But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping So as she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb,3
26880,and she saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain,3
26881,They told her Woman why are you weeping She said to them Because they have taken away my Lord and I dont know where they have laid him,3
26882,When she had said this she turned around and saw Jesus standing and didnt know that it was Jesus,3
26883,Jesus said to her Woman why are you weeping Who are you looking for She supposing him to be the gardener said to him Sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away,3
26884,Jesus said to her Mary She turned and said to him Rhabbouni! which is to say Teacher!,3
26885,Jesus said to her Dont touch me for I havent yet ascended to my Father but go to my brothers and tell them I am ascending to my Father and your Father to my God and your God,3
26886,Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her,3
26887,When therefore it was evening on that day the first day of the week and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them Peace be to you,3
26888,When he had said this he showed them his hands and his side The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord,3
26889,Jesus therefore said to them again Peace be to you As the Father has sent me even so I send you,3
26890,When he had said this he breathed on them and said to them Receive the Holy Spirit!,3
26891,Whoevers sins you forgive they are forgiven them Whoevers sins you retain they have been retained,3
26892,But Thomas one of the twelve called Didymus wasnt with them when Jesus came,3
26893,The other disciples therefore said to him We have seen the Lord! But he said to them Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my hand into his side I will not believe,3
26894,After eight days again his disciples were inside and Thomas was with them Jesus came the doors being locked and stood in the midst and said Peace be to you,3
26895,Then he said to Thomas Reach here your finger and see my hands Reach here your hand and put it into my side Dont be unbelieving but believing,3
26896,Thomas answered him My Lord and my God!,3
26897,Jesus said to him Because you have seen meTR adds  Thomas you have believed Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed,3
26898,Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book,3
26899,but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing you may have life in his name,3
26900,After these things Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias He revealed himself this way,3
26901,Simon Peter Thomas called Didymus Nathanael of Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were together,3
26902,Simon Peter said to them Im going fishing They told him We are also coming with you They immediately went out and entered into the boat That night they caught nothing,3
26903,But when day had already come Jesus stood on the beach yet the disciples didnt know that it was Jesus,3
26904,Jesus therefore said to them Children have you anything to eat They answered him No,3
26905,He said to them Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some They cast it therefore and now they werent able to draw it in for the multitude of fish,3
26906,That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter Its the Lord! So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he wrapped his coat around him for he was naked and threw himself into the sea,3
26907,But the other disciples came in the little boat for they were not far from the land but about two hundred cubits200 cubits is about 100 yards or about 91 meters away dragging the net full of fish,3
26908,So when they got out on the land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid on it and bread,3
26909,Jesus said to them Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,3
26910,Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fish one hundred fiftythree and even though there were so many the net wasnt torn,3
26911,Jesus said to them Come and eat breakfast None of the disciples dared inquire of him Who are you knowing that it was the Lord,3
26912,Then Jesus came and took the bread gave it to them and the fish likewise,3
26913,This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples after he had risen from the dead,3
26914,So when they had eaten their breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonah do you love me more than these He said to him Yes Lord you know that I have affection for you He said to him Feed my lambs,3
26915,He said to him again a second time Simon son of Jonah do you love me He said to him Yes Lord you know that I have affection for you He said to him Tend my sheep,3
26916,He said to him the third time Simon son of Jonah do you have affection for me Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time Do you have affection for me He said to him Lord you know everything You know that I have affection for you Jesus said to him Feed my sheep,3
26917,Most assuredly I tell you when you were young you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted to But when you are old you will stretch out your hands and another will dress you and carry you where you dont want to go,3
26918,Now he said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God When he had said this he said to him Follow me,3
26919,Then Peter turning around saw a disciple following This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved the one who had also leaned on Jesus breast at the supper and asked Lord who is going to betray You,3
26920,Peter seeing him said to Jesus Lord what about this man,3
26921,Jesus said to him If I desire that he stay until I come what is that to you You follow me,3
26922,This saying therefore went out among the brothersThe word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings that this disciple wouldnt die Yet Jesus didnt say to him that he wouldnt die but If I desire that he stay until I come what is that to you,3
26923,This is the disciple who testifies about these things and wrote these things We know that his witness is true,3
26924,There are also many other things which Jesus did which if they would all be written I suppose that even the world itself wouldnt have room for the books that would be written,3
