23164,Joseph her husband being a righteous man and not willing to make her a public example intended to put her away secretly,1.0
23165,But when he thought about these things behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph son of David dont be afraid to take to yourself Mary your wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit,1.0
23167,Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet saying,1.0
23168,Behold the virgin shall be with child And shall bring forth a son They shall call his name Immanuel Which is being interpreted God with us,1.0
23169,Joseph arose from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife to himself,1.0
23170,and didnt know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son He named him Jesus,1.0
23171,Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold wise men{The word for wise men magoi can also mean teachers priests physicians astrologers seers interpreters of dreams or sorcerers} from the east came to Jerusalem saying,1.0
23174,Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he asked them where the Christ would be born,1.0

23197,Now John himself wore clothing made of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist His food was locusts and wild honey,1.0
23198,Then people from Jerusalem all of Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him,1.0
23200,But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism he said to them You offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come,1.0
23201,Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!,1.0
23202,Dont think to yourselves We have Abraham for our father for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones,1.0

23206,Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him,1.0
23207,But John would have hindered him saying I need to be baptized by you and you come to me,1.0
23210,Behold a voice out of the heavens said This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased,1.0

23214,But he answered It is written Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God,1.0
23215,Then the devil took him into the holy city He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,1.0
23217,Jesus said to him Again it is written You shall not test the Lord your God,1.0
23219,He said to him I will give you all of these things if you will fall down and worship me,1.0

23229,He said to them Come after me and I will make you fishers for men,1.0
23231,Going on from there he saw two other brothers James the son of Zebedee and John his brother in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets He called them,1.0
23232,They immediately left the boat and their father and followed him,1.0
23233,Jesus went about in all Galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people,1.0
23236,Seeing the multitudes he went up onto the mountain When he had sat down his disciples came to him,1.0
23238,Blessed are the poor in spirit For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,1.0
23239,Blessed are those who mourn For they shall be comforted,1.0
23240,Blessed are the gentle For they shall inherit the earth,1.0
23241,Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness For they shall be filled,1.0
23242,Blessed are the merciful For they shall obtain mercy,1.0
23243,Blessed are the pure in heart For they shall see God,1.0
23244,Blessed are the peacemakers For they shall be called children of God,1.0
23245,Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,1.0
23246,Blessed are you when people reproach you persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake,1.0
23247,Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you,1.0
23248,You are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its flavor with what will it be salted It is then good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men,1.0
23250,Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket but on a stand and it shines to all who are in the house,1.0
23251,Even so let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven,1.0
23253,For most assuredly I tell you until heaven and earth pass away not even one smallest letter{literally iota} or one tiny pen stroke{or serif} shall in any way pass away from the law until all things are accomplished,1.0
23254,Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven,1.0
23255,For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,1.0
23257,But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whoever shall say to his brother Raca{Raca is an Aramaic insult related to the word for empty and conveying the idea of emptyheadedness}! shall be in danger of the council and whoever shall say You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna{Gehenna is another name for Hell that brings to mind an image of a burning garbage dump with dead bodies in it},1.0
23258,If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you,1.0
23259,leave your gift there before the altar and go your way First be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer your gift,1.0
23263,but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart,1.0
23264,If your right eye causes you to stumble pluck it out and throw it away from you For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna,1.0
23266,It was also said Whoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorce,1.0
23267,but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife except for the cause of sexual immorality makes her an adulteress and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery,1.0
23270,nor by the earth for it is the footstool of his feet nor by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King,1.0
23272,But let your Yes be Yes and your No be no Whatever is more than these is of the evil one,1.0
23274,But I tell you dont resist him who is evil but whoever strikes you on your right cheek turn to him the other also,1.0
23277,Give to him who asks you and dont turn away him who desires to borrow from you,1.0
23278,You have heard that it was said You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy,1.0
23279,But I tell you love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,1.0
23280,that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust,1.0
23281,For if you love those who love you what reward do you have Dont even the tax collectors do the same,1.0
23282,If you only greet your friends what more do you do than others Dont even the tax collectors do the same,1.0
23284,Be careful that you dont do your charitable giving before men to be seen by them or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven,1.0
23285,Therefore when you do merciful deeds dont sound a trumpet before yourself as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may get glory from men Most assuredly I tell you they have received their reward,1.0
23288,When you pray you shall not be as the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen by men Most assuredly I tell you they have received their reward,1.0
23289,But you when you pray enter into your inner chamber and having shut your door pray to your Father who is in secret and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly,1.0
23290,In praying dont use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking,1.0
23291,Therefore dont be like them for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him,1.0
23293,Let your Kingdom come Let your will be done as in heaven so on earth,1.0
23295,Forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors,1.0
23296,Bring us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one For yours is the Kingdom the power and the glory forever Amen,1.0
23298,But if you dont forgive men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,1.0
23299,Moreover when you fast dont be like the hypocrites with sad faces For they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting Most assuredly I tell you they have received their reward,1.0
23300,But you when you fast anoint your head and wash your face,1.0
23301,so that you are not seen by men to be fasting but by your Father who is in secret and your Father who sees in secret will reward you,1.0
23302,Dont lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break through and steal,1.0
23304,for where your treasure is there your heart will be also,1.0
23305,The lamp of the body is the eye If therefore your eye is sound your whole body will be full of light,1.0
23306,But if your eye is evil your whole body will be full of darkness If therefore the light that is in you is darkness how great is the darkness!,1.0
23307,No one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other You cant serve both God and Mammon,1.0
23308,Therefore I tell you dont be anxious for your life what you will eat or what you will drink nor yet for your body what you will wear Isnt life more than food and the body more than clothing,1.0
23309,See the birds of the sky that they dont sow neither do they reap nor gather into barns Your heavenly Father feeds them Arent you of much more value than they,1.0
23310,Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to the measure of his life,1.0
23311,Why are you anxious about clothing Consider the lilies of the field how they grow They dont toil neither do they spin,1.0
23312,yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these,1.0
23314,Therefore dont be anxious saying What will we eat What will we drink or With what will we be clothed,1.0
23318,Dont judge so that you wont be judged,1.0
23319,For with whatever judgment you judge you will be judged and with whatever measure you measure it will be measured to you,1.0
23322,You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brothers eye,1.0
23323,Dont give that which is holy to the dogs neither throw your pearls before the pigs lest perhaps they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces,1.0
23324,Ask and it will be given you Seek and you will find Knock and it will be opened for you,1.0
23325,For everyone who asks receives He who seeks finds To him who knocks it will be opened,1.0
23326,Or who is there among you who if his son asks him for bread will give him a stone,1.0
23328,If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!,1.0
23330,Enter in by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many are those who enter in by it,1.0
23331,How{TR reads Because instead of How} narrow is the gate and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it,1.0
23332,Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves,1.0
23334,Even so every good tree produces good fruit but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit,1.0
23337,Therefore by their fruits you will know them,1.0
23338,Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven,1.0
23339,Many will tell me in that day Lord Lord didnt we prophesy in your name in your name cast out demons and in your name do many mighty works,1.0
23340,Then I will tell them I never knew you Depart from me you who work iniquity,1.0
23342,The rain came down the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house and it didnt fall for it was founded on the rock,1.0
23343,Everyone who hears these words of mine and doesnt do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand,1.0
23344,The rain came down the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house and it felland great was its fall,1.0
23345,It happened when Jesus had finished saying these things that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,1.0
23346,for he taught them with authority and not like the scribes,1.0
23347,When he came down from the mountain great multitudes followed him,1.0
23348,Behold a leper came to him and worshiped him saying Lord if you want to you can make me clean,1.0
23350,Jesus said to him See that you tell nobody but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded as a testimony to them,1.0
23351,When he came into Capernaum a centurion came to him asking him,1.0
23352,and saying Lord my servant lies in the house paralyzed grievously tormented,1.0
23353,Jesus said to him I will come and heal him,1.0
23354,The centurion answered Lord Im not worthy for you to come under my roof Just say the word and my servant will be healed,1.0
23355,For I am also a man under authority having under myself soldiers I tell this one Go and he goes and tell another Come and he comes and tell my servant Do this and he does it,1.0
23356,When Jesus heard it he marveled and said to those who followed Most assuredly I tell you I havent found so great a faith not even in Israel,1.0
23358,but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth,1.0
23361,He touched her hand and the fever left her She got up and served him{TR reads them instead of him},1.0
23362,When evening came they brought to him many possessed with demons He cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick,1.0
23363,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying He took our infirmities and bore our diseases,1.0
23365,A scribe came and said to him Teacher I will follow you wherever you go,1.0
23366,Jesus said to him The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head,1.0
23368,But Jesus said to him Follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead,1.0
23369,When he got into a boat his disciples followed him,1.0
23370,Behold a great tempest arose in the sea so much that the boat was covered with the waves but he was asleep,1.0
23371,They came to him and woke him up saying Save us Lord! We are dying!,1.0
23372,He said to them Why are you fearful oh you of little faith Then he got up rebuked the wind and the sea and there was a great calm,1.0
23374,When he came to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes two people possessed by demons met him there coming out of the tombs exceedingly fierce so that nobody could pass by that way,1.0
23375,Behold they cried out saying What do we have to do with you Jesus Son of God Have you come here to torment us before the time,1.0
23376,Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them,1.0
23377,The demons begged him saying If you cast us out permit us to go away into the herd of pigs,1.0
23379,Those who fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything including what happened to those who were possessed with demons,1.0
23381,He entered into a boat and crossed over and came into his own city,1.0
23382,Behold they brought to him a man who was paralyzed lying on a bed Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic Son cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you,1.0
23383,Behold some of the scribes said to themselves This man blasphemes,1.0
23385,For which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up and walk,1.0
23386,But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins then he said to the paralytic Get up and take up your mat and go up to your house,1.0
23387,He arose and departed to his house,1.0
23389,As Jesus passed by from there he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office He said to him Follow me He got up and followed him,1.0
23393,But you go and learn what this means I desire mercy and not sacrifice for I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance,1.0
23394,Then Johns disciples came to him saying Why do we and the Pharisees fast often but your disciples dont fast,1.0
23395,Jesus said to them Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast,1.0
23398,While he told these things to them behold a ruler came and worshiped him saying My daughter has just died but come and lay your hand on her and she will live,1.0
23402,But Jesus turning around and seeing her said Daughter cheer up! Your faith has made you well And the woman was made well from that hour,1.0
23403,When Jesus came into the rulers house and saw the flute players and the crowd in noisy disorder,1.0
23404,he said to them Make room because the girl isnt dead but sleeping They were ridiculing him,1.0
23408,When he had come into the house the blind men came to him Jesus said to them Do you believe that I am able to do this They told him Yes Lord,1.0
23410,Their eyes were opened Jesus strictly charged them saying See that no one knows about this,1.0
23412,As they went out behold a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him,1.0
23413,When the demon was cast out the mute man spoke The multitudes marveled saying Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!,1.0
23414,But the Pharisees said By the prince of the demons he casts out demons,1.0
23415,Jesus went about all the cities and the villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people,1.0
23416,But when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed{TR reads weary instead of harassed} and scattered like sheep without a shepherd,1.0
23417,Then he said to his disciples The harvest indeed is plentiful but the laborers are few,1.0
23418,Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest,1.0
23424,Rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,1.0
23425,As you go preach saying The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!,1.0
23426,Heal the sick cleanse the lepers{TR adds  raise the dead} and cast out demons Freely you received so freely give,1.0
23427,Dont take any gold nor silver nor brass in your money belts,1.0
23428,Take no bag for your journey neither two coats nor shoes nor staff for the laborer is worthy of his food,1.0
23429,Into whatever city or village you enter find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you go on,1.0
23430,As you enter into the household greet it,1.0
23431,If the household is worthy let your peace come on it but if it isnt worthy let your peace return to you,1.0
23432,Whoever doesnt receive you nor hear your words as you go out of that house or that city shake off the dust from your feet,1.0
23434,Behold I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves,1.0
23435,But beware of men for they will deliver you up to councils and in their synagogues they will scourge you,1.0
23437,But when they deliver you up dont be anxious how or what you will say for it will be given you in that hour what you will say,1.0
23439,Brother will deliver up brother to death and the father his child Children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death,1.0
23440,You will be hated by all men for my names sake but he who endures to the end will be saved,1.0
23444,Therefore dont be afraid of them for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed and hidden that will not be known,1.0
23445,What I tell you in the darkness speak in the light and what you hear whispered in the ear proclaim on the housetops,1.0
23447,Arent two sparrows sold for an assarion{An assarion is a small coin worth one tenth of a drachma or a sixteenth of a denarius approximately the wages of one half hour of agricultural labor} Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Fathers will,1.0
23448,but the very hairs of your head are all numbered,1.0
23449,Therefore dont be afraid You are of more value than many sparrows,1.0
23451,But whoever denies me before men him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven,1.0
23452,Dont think that I came to send peace on the earth I didnt come to send peace but a sword,1.0
23457,He who finds his life will lose it and he who loses his life for my sake will find it,1.0
23459,He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous mans reward,1.0
23460,Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple most assuredly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward,1.0
23461,It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities,1.0
23462,Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples,1.0
23464,Jesus answered them Go and tell John the things which you hear and see,1.0
23467,As these went their way Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John What did you go out into the wilderness to see A reed shaken by the wind,1.0
23468,But what did you go out to see A man in soft clothing Behold those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses,1.0
23469,But why did you go out To see a prophet Yes I tell you and much more than a prophet,1.0
23471,Most assuredly I tell you among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he,1.0
23472,From the days of John the Baptizer until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force,1.0
23475,He who has ears to hear let him hear,1.0
23476,But to what shall I compare this generation It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call to their companions,1.0
23480,Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done because they didnt repent,1.0
23482,But I tell you it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you,1.0
23483,You Capernaum who are exalted to Heaven you will go down to Hades For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you it would have remained until this day,1.0
23484,But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you,1.0
23485,At that time Jesus answered I thank you Father Lord of heaven and earth that you hid these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to infants,1.0
23488,Come to me all you who labor and are heavily burdened and I will give you rest,1.0
23490,For my yoke is easy and my burden is light,1.0
23491,At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat,1.0
23494,how he entered into the house of God and ate the show bread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for those who were with him but only for the priests,1.0
23496,But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here,1.0
23497,But if you had known what this means I desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless,1.0
23498,For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath,1.0
23502,Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day,1.0
23503,Then he told the man Stretch out your hand He stretched it out and it was restored whole just like the other,1.0
23505,Jesus perceiving that withdrew from there Great multitudes followed him and he healed them all,1.0
23507,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying,1.0
23509,He will not strive nor shout Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets,1.0
23512,Then one possessed by a demon blind and mute was brought to him and he healed him so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw,1.0
23514,But when the Pharisees heard it they said This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul the prince of the demons,1.0
23515,Knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself will not stand,1.0
23517,If I by Beelzebul cast out demons by whom do your children cast them out Therefore they will be your judges,1.0
23518,But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons then the Kingdom of God has come upon you,1.0
23521,Therefore I tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men,1.0
23522,Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man it will be forgiven him but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit it will not be forgiven him neither in this age nor in that which is to come,1.0
23523,Either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt for the tree is known by its fruit,1.0
23524,You offspring of vipers how can you being evil speak good things For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,1.0
23525,The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things and the evil man out of his evil treasure{TR adds of the heart} brings out evil things,1.0
23526,I tell you that every idle word that men speak they will give account of it in the day of judgment,1.0
23527,For by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned,1.0
23528,Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered Teacher we want to see a sign from you,1.0
23532,The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold someone greater than Solomon is here,1.0
23533,But the unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man passes through waterless places seeking rest and doesnt find it,1.0
23534,Then he says I will return into my house from which I came out and when he has come back he finds it empty swept and put in order,1.0
23536,While he was yet speaking to the multitudes behold his mother and his brothers stood outside seeking to speak to him,1.0
23537,One said to him Behold your mother and your brothers stand outside seeking to speak to you,1.0
23541,On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside,1.0
23542,Great multitudes gathered to him so that he entered into a boat and sat and all the multitude stood on the beach,1.0
23544,As he sowed some seeds fell by the roadside and the birds came and devoured them,1.0
23545,Others fell on rocky ground where they didnt have much soil and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth,1.0
23546,When the sun had risen they were scorched Because they had no root they withered away,1.0
23547,Others fell among thorns The thorns grew up and choked them,1.0
23548,and others fell on good soil and yielded fruit some one hundred times as much some sixty and some thirty,1.0
23549,He who has ears to hear let him hear,1.0
23554,In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled which says  By hearing you will hear And will in no way understand Seeing you will see And will in no way perceive,1.0
23556,But blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear,1.0
23557,For most assuredly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see and didnt see them and to hear the things which you hear and didnt hear them,1.0
23558,Hear then the parable of the farmer,1.0
23559,When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesnt understand it the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart This is what was sown by the roadside,1.0
23564,He set another parable before them saying The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,1.0
23566,But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit then the darnel appeared also,1.0
23567,The servants of the householder came and said to him Sir didnt you sow good seed in your field Where did this darnel come from,1.0
23568,He said to them An enemy has done this The servants asked him Do you want us to go and gather them up,1.0
23570,Let both grow together until the harvest and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers First gather up the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn,1.0
23571,He set another parable before them saying The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field,1.0
23572,which indeed is smaller than all seeds But when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches,1.0
23573,He spoke another parable to them The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures{Literally satas 3 satas  about 05 bushel or 22 litres} of meal until it was all leavened,1.0
23575,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying  I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world,1.0
23577,He answered them He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,1.0
23578,the field is the world and the good seed these are the children of the Kingdom and the darnel are the children of the evil one,1.0
23579,The enemy who sowed them is the devil The harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels,1.0
23580,As therefore the darnel is gathered up and burned with fire so will it be at the end of this age,1.0
23581,The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and those who do iniquity,1.0
23582,and will cast them into the furnace of fire There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth,1.0
23584,Again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid In his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field,1.0
23587,Again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some fish of every kind,1.0
23589,So will it be in the end of the world The angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous,1.0
23590,and will cast them into the furnace of fire There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth,1.0
23591,Jesus said to them Have you understood all these things They answered him Yes Lord,1.0
23593,It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables he departed from there,1.0
23595,Isnt this the carpenters son Isnt his mother called Mary and his brothers James Joses Simon and Judas,1.0
23596,Arent all of his sisters with us Where then did this man get all of these things,1.0
23597,They were offended by him But Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house,1.0
23598,He didnt do many mighty works there because of their unbelief,1.0
23599,At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,1.0
23601,For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias his brother Philips wife,1.0
23603,When he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet,1.0
23605,Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask,1.0
23607,The king was grieved but for the sake of his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him he commanded it to be given,1.0
23613,When evening had come his disciples came to him saying This place is deserted and the hour is already late Send the multitudes away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food,1.0
23614,But Jesus said to them They dont need to go away You give them something to eat,1.0
23615,They told him We only have here five loaves and two fish,1.0
23616,He said Bring them here to me,1.0
23617,He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass and he took the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he blessed broke and gave the loaves to the disciples and the disciples gave to the multitudes,1.0
23618,They all ate and were filled They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces,1.0
23619,Those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children,1.0
23620,Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and to go ahead of him to the other side while he sent the multitudes away,1.0
23622,But the boat was now in the middle of the sea distressed by the waves for the wind was contrary,1.0
23623,In the fourth watch of the night{The night was equally divided into four watches so the fourth watch is approximately 300 A M to sunrise} Jesus came to them walking on the sea,1.0
23624,When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying Its a ghost! and they cried out for fear,1.0
23625,But immediately Jesus spoke to them saying Cheer up! I AM!{see Exodus 314} Dont be afraid,1.0
23626,Peter answered him and said Lord if it is you command me to come to you on the waters,1.0
23627,He said Come! Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the waters to come to Jesus,1.0
23628,But when he saw that the wind was strong he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out saying Lord save me!,1.0
23629,Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand took hold of him and said to him You of little faith why did you doubt,1.0
23630,When they got up into the boat the wind ceased,1.0
23632,When they had crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret,1.0
23633,When the men of that place recognized him they sent into all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick,1.0
23635,Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem saying,1.0
23638,For God commanded Honor your father and your mother and He who speaks evil of father or mother let him be put to death,1.0
23640,he shall not honor his father or mother You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition,1.0
23641,You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying,1.0
23642,These people draw near to me with their mouth And honor me with their lips But their heart is far from me,1.0
23643,And in vain do they worship me Teaching as doctrine rules made by men,1.0
23647,But he answered Every plant which my heavenly Father didnt plant will be uprooted,1.0
23648,Leave them alone They are blind guides of the blind If the blind guide the blind both will fall into a pit,1.0
23651,Dont you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body,1.0
23652,But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart and they defile the man,1.0
23653,For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts murders adulteries sexual sins thefts false testimony and blasphemies,1.0
23654,These are the things which defile the man but to eat with unwashed hands doesnt defile the man,1.0
23655,Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon,1.0
23657,But he answered her not a word His disciples came and begged him saying Send her away for she cries after us,1.0
23658,But he answered I wasnt sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel,1.0
23659,But she came and worshiped him saying Lord help me,1.0
23661,But she said Yes Lord but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters table,1.0
23662,Then Jesus answered her Woman great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire And her daughter was healed from that hour,1.0
23663,Jesus departed there and came near to the sea of Galilee and he went up into the mountain and sat there,1.0
23665,so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking injured whole lame walking and blind seeingand they glorified the God of Israel,1.0
23666,Jesus summoned his disciples and said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat I dont want to send them away fasting or they might faint on the way,1.0
23668,Jesus said to them How many loaves do you have They said Seven and a few small fish,1.0
23670,and he took the seven loaves and the fish He gave thanks and broke them and gave to the disciples and the disciples to the multitudes,1.0
23671,They all ate and were filled They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over,1.0
23672,Those who ate were four thousand men besides women and children,1.0
23673,Then he sent away the multitudes got into the boat and came into the borders of Magdala,1.0
23676,In the morning It will be foul weather today for the sky is red and threatening Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky but you cant discern the signs of the times!,1.0
23677,An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign and there will be no sign given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah He left them and departed,1.0
23678,The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread,1.0
23679,Jesus said to them Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,1.0
23681,Jesus perceiving it said Why do you reason among yourselves you of little faith because you have brought no bread,1.0
23682,Dont you yet perceive neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you took up,1.0
23683,Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up,1.0
23684,How is it that you dont perceive that I didnt speak to you concerning bread But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,1.0
23685,Then they understood that he didnt tell them to beware of the yeast of bread but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees,1.0
23686,Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying Who do men say that I the Son of Man am,1.0
23687,They said Some say John the Baptizer some Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets,1.0
23689,Simon Peter answered You are the Christ the Son of the living God,1.0
23691,I also tell you that you are Peter{Peters name Petros in Greek is the word for a specific rock or stone} and on this rock{Greek petra a rock mass or bedrock} I will build my assembly and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it,1.0
23692,I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven,1.0
23693,Then he charged the disciples that they should tell no one that he is Jesus the Christ,1.0
23695,Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying Far be it from you Lord! This will never be done to you,1.0
23697,Then Jesus said to his disciples If anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me,1.0
23698,For whoever desires to save his life will lose it and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it,1.0
23699,For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life Or what will a man give in exchange for his life,1.0
23700,For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds,1.0
23701,Most assuredly I tell you there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom,1.0
23702,After six days Jesus took with him Peter James and John his brother and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves,1.0
23704,Behold Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him,1.0
23705,Peter answered and said to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here If you want lets make three tents here one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah,1.0
23706,While he was still speaking behold a bright cloud overshadowed them Behold a voice came out of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased Listen to him,1.0
23707,When the disciples heard it they fell on their faces and were very afraid,1.0
23709,Lifting up their eyes they saw no one except Jesus alone,1.0
23711,His disciples asked him saying Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first,1.0
23713,but I tell you that Elijah has come already and they didnt recognize him but did to him whatever they wanted to Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them,1.0
23716,Lord have mercy on my son for he is epileptic and suffers grievously for he often falls into the fire and often into the water,1.0
23717,So I brought him to your disciples and they could not cure him,1.0
23719,Jesus rebuked him the demon went out of him and the boy was cured from that hour,1.0
23720,Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said Why werent we able to cast it out,1.0
23721,He said to them Because of your unbelief For most assuredly I tell you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you will tell this mountain Move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you,1.0
23722,But this kind doesnt go out except by prayer and fasting,1.0
23723,While they were staying in Galilee Jesus said to them The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,1.0
23725,When they had come to Capernaum those who collected the didrachma coins{A didrachma is a Greek silver coin worth 2 drachmas about as much as 2 Roman denarii or about 2 days wages It was commonly used to pay the halfshekel temple tax because 2 drachmas were worth one half shekel of silver} came to Peter and said Doesnt your teacher pay the didrachma,1.0
23726,He said Yes When he came into the house Jesus anticipated him saying What do you think Simon From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute From their children or from strangers,1.0
23727,Peter said to him From strangers Jesus said to him Therefore the children are exempt,1.0
23728,But lest we cause them to stumble go to the sea and cast a hook and take up the first fish that comes up When you have opened its mouth you will find a stater coin{A stater is a silver coin equivalent to four Attic or two Alexandrian drachmas or a Jewish shekel just exactly enough to cover the halfshekel Temple Tax for two people} Take that and give it to them for me and you,1.0
23729,In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven,1.0
23730,Jesus called a little child to himself and set him in the midst of them,1.0
23731,and said Most assuredly I tell you unless you turn and become as little children you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,1.0
23732,Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven,1.0
23734,but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea,1.0
23735,Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!,1.0
23743,If your brother sins against you go show him his fault between you and him alone If he listens to you you have gained back your brother,1.0
23745,If he refuses to listen to them tell it to the assembly If he refuses to hear the assembly also let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector,1.0
23746,Most assuredly I tell you whatever things you will bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever things you will release on earth will be released in heaven,1.0
23747,Again assuredly I tell you that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven,1.0
23749,Then Peter came and said to him Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him Until seven times,1.0
23750,Jesus said to him I dont tell you until seven times but until seventy times seven,1.0
23753,But because he couldnt pay his lord commanded him to be sold with his wife his children and all that he had and payment to be made,1.0
23754,The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him saying Lord have patience with me and I will repay you all!,1.0
23755,The lord of that servant being moved with compassion released him and forgave him the debt,1.0
23757,So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him saying Have patience with me and I will repay you!,1.0
23758,He would not but went and cast him into prison until he should pay back that which was due,1.0
23759,So when his fellow servants saw what was done they were exceedingly sorry and came and told to their lord all that was done,1.0
23760,Then his lord called him in and said to him You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me,1.0
23761,Shouldnt you also have had mercy on your fellow servant even as I had mercy on you,1.0
23764,It happened when Jesus had finished these words he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan,1.0
23768,and said For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall join to his wife and the two shall become one flesh,1.0
23770,They asked him Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce and divorce her,1.0
23772,I tell you that whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery,1.0
23774,But he said to them Not all men can receive this saying but those to whom it is given,1.0
23776,Then little children were brought to him that he should lay his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them,1.0
23778,He laid his hands on them and departed from there,1.0
23779,Behold one came to him and said Good teacher what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life,1.0
23780,He said to him Why do you call me good No one is good but one that is God But if you want to enter into life keep the commandments,1.0
23784,Jesus said to him If you want to be perfect go sell what you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me,1.0
23785,But when the young man heard the saying he went away sad for he was one who had great possessions,1.0
23786,Jesus said to his disciples Most assuredly I say to you a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty,1.0
23788,When the disciples heard it they were exceedingly astonished saying Who then can be saved,1.0
23790,Then Peter answered Behold we have left everything and followed you What then will we have,1.0
23791,Jesus said to them Most assuredly I tell you that you who have followed me in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel,1.0
23792,Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake will receive one hundred times and will inherit eternal life,1.0
23794,For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard,1.0
23795,When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius{A denarius is a silver Roman coin worth 125th of a Roman aureus This was a common wage for a day of farm labor} a day he sent them into his vineyard,1.0
23799,About the eleventh hour{500 PM} he went out and found others standing idle He said to them Why do you stand here all day idle,1.0
23800,They said to him Because no one has hired us He said to them You also go into the vineyard and you will receive whatever is right,1.0
23803,When the first came they supposed that they would receive more and they likewise each received a denarius,1.0
23804,When they received it they murmured against the master of the household,1.0
23806,But he answered one of them Friend I am doing you no wrong Didnt you agree with me for a denarius,1.0
23808,Isnt it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own Or is your eye evil because I am good,1.0
23810,As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside and on the way he said to them,1.0
23811,Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death,1.0
23813,Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons kneeling and asking a certain thing of him,1.0
23814,He said to her What do you want She said to him Command that these my two sons may sit one on your right hand and one on your left hand in your Kingdom,1.0
23817,When the ten heard it they were indignant with the two brothers,1.0
23818,But Jesus summoned them and said You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them,1.0
23819,It shall not be so among you but whoever desires to become great among you shall be{TR reads let him be instead of shall be} your servant,1.0
23821,even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many,1.0
23823,Behold two blind men sitting by the road when they heard that Jesus was passing by cried out Lord have mercy on us you son of David!,1.0
23824,The multitude rebuked them telling them that they should be quiet but they cried out even more Lord have mercy on us you son of David!,1.0
23825,Jesus stood still and called them and asked What do you want me to do for you,1.0
23826,They told him Lord that our eyes may be opened,1.0
23827,Jesus being moved with compassion touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received their sight and they followed him,1.0
23828,When they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethsphage{TR reads Bethphage instead of Bethsphage} to the Mount of Olives then Jesus sent two disciples,1.0
23829,saying to them Go into the village that is opposite you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her Untie them and bring them to me,1.0
23831,All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying,1.0
23832,Tell the daughter of Zion Behold your King comes to you Humble and riding on a donkey On a colt the foal of a donkey,1.0
23833,The disciples went and did just as Jesus commanded them,1.0
23834,and brought the donkey and the colt and laid their clothes on them and he sat on them,1.0
23836,The multitudes who went before him and who followed kept shouting Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!,1.0
23840,He said to them It is written My house shall be called a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers!,1.0
23841,The blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them,1.0
23842,But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children who were crying in the temple and saying Hosanna to the son of David! they were indignant,1.0
23843,and said to him Do you hear what these are saying Jesus said to them Yes Did you never read Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise,1.0
23845,Now in the morning as he returned to the city he was hungry,1.0
23846,Seeing a fig tree by the road he came to it and found nothing on it but leaves He said to it Let there be no fruit from you forever! Immediately the fig tree withered away,1.0
23847,When the disciples saw it they marveled saying How did the fig tree immediately wither away,1.0
23849,All things whatever you ask in prayer believing you will receive,1.0
23851,Jesus answered them I also will ask you one question which if you tell me I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things,1.0
23852,The baptism of John where was it from From heaven or from men They reasoned with themselves saying If we say From heaven he will ask us Why then did you not believe him,1.0
23853,But if we say From men we fear the multitude for all hold John as a prophet,1.0
23856,He answered I will not but afterward he changed his mind and went,1.0
23857,He came to the second and said the same thing He answered I go sir but he didnt go,1.0
23858,Which of the two did the will of his father They said to him The first Jesus said to them Most assuredly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you,1.0
23859,For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you didnt believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him When you saw it you didnt even repent afterward that you might believe him,1.0
23860,Hear another parable There was a man who was a master of a household who planted a vineyard set a hedge about it dug a winepress in it built a tower leased it out to farmers and went into another country,1.0
23864,But afterward he sent to them his son saying They will respect my son,1.0
23866,So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,1.0
23867,When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes what will he do to those farmers,1.0
23868,They told him He will miserably destroy those miserable men and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in its season,1.0
23870,Therefore I tell you the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruits,1.0
23871,He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces but on whoever it will fall it will scatter him as dust,1.0
23872,When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables they perceived that he spoke about them,1.0
23875,The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who made a marriage feast for his son,1.0
23876,and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast but they would not come,1.0
23878,But they made light of it and went their ways one to his own farm another to his merchandise,1.0
23879,and the rest grabbed his servants and treated them shamefully and killed them,1.0
23880,When the king heard that he was angry and he sent his armies destroyed those murderers and burned their city,1.0
23883,Those servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found both bad and good The wedding was filled with guests,1.0
23884,But when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man who didnt have on wedding clothing,1.0
23885,and he said to him Friend how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing He was speechless,1.0
23889,They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians saying Teacher we know that you are honest and teach the way of God in truth no matter who you teach for you arent partial to anyone,1.0
23890,Tell us therefore what do you think Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not,1.0
23891,But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said Why do you test me you hypocrites,1.0
23892,Show me the tax money They brought to him a denarius,1.0
23893,He asked them Whose is this image and inscription,1.0
23894,They said to him Caesars Then he said to them Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are Gods,1.0
23895,When they heard it they marveled and left him and went away,1.0
23897,saying Teacher Moses said If a man dies having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed for his brother,1.0
23898,Now there were with us seven brothers The first married and died and having no seed left his wife to his brother,1.0
23900,After them all the woman died,1.0
23901,In the resurrection therefore whose wife will she be of the seven For they all had her,1.0
23904,But concerning the resurrection of the dead havent you read that which was spoken to you by God saying,1.0
23905,I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob God is not the God of the dead but of the living,1.0
23906,When the multitudes heard it they were astonished at his teaching,1.0
23907,But the Pharisees when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence gathered themselves together,1.0
23908,One of them a lawyer asked him a question testing him,1.0
23909,Teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law,1.0
23910,Jesus said to him You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind,1.0
23911,This is the first and great commandment,1.0
23912,A second likewise is this You shall love your neighbor as yourself,1.0
23913,The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments,1.0
23915,saying What do you think of the Christ Whose son is he They said to him Of David,1.0
23916,He said to them How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord saying,1.0
23917,The Lord said to my Lord Sit on my right hand Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet,1.0
23918,If then David calls him Lord how is he his son,1.0
23920,Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,1.0
23921,saying The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses seat,1.0
23922,All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe observe and do but dont do their works for they say and dont do,1.0
23923,For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them,1.0
23925,and love the place of honor at feasts the best seats in the synagogues,1.0
23927,But dont you be called Rabbi for one is your teacher the Christ and all of you are brothers,1.0
23928,Call no man on the earth your father for one is your Father he who is in heaven,1.0
23929,Neither be called masters for one is your master the Christ,1.0
23931,Whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted,1.0
23933,But woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for you dont enter in yourselves neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter{Some Greek manuscripts reverse the order of verses 13 and 14 and some omit verse 13 numbering verse 14 as 13},1.0
23934,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte and when he becomes one you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna as yourselves,1.0
23935,Woe to you you blind guides who say Whoever swears by the temple it is nothing but whoever swears by the gold of the temple he is obligated,1.0
23936,You blind fools! For which is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold,1.0
23938,You blind fools! For which is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift,1.0
23939,He therefore who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it,1.0
23940,He who swears by the temple swears by it and by him who was living in it,1.0
23941,He who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits on it,1.0
23942,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you tithe mint dill and cumin{ cumin is an aromatic seed from Cuminum cyminum resembling caraway in flavor and appearance It is used as a spice} and have left undone the weightier matters of the law justice mercy and faith But you ought to have done these and not to have left the other undone,1.0
23944,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness{TR reads selfindulgence instead of unrighteousness},1.0
23945,You blind Pharisee first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter that the outside of it may become clean also,1.0
23946,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly are full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness,1.0
23947,Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity,1.0
23948,Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous,1.0
23949,and say If we had lived in the days of our fathers we wouldnt have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets,1.0
23951,Fill up then the measure of your fathers,1.0
23952,You serpents you offspring of vipers how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna,1.0
23953,Therefore behold I send to you prophets wise men and scribes Some of them you will kill and crucify and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,1.0
23954,that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar,1.0
23955,Most assuredly I tell you all these things will come upon this generation,1.0
23956,Jerusalem Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often would I have gathered your children together even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings and you would not!,1.0
23959,Jesus went out from the temple and was going on his way His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple,1.0
23960,But he answered them Dont you see all of these things Most assuredly I tell you there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down,1.0
23961,As he sat on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately saying Tell us when will these things be What is the sign of your coming and of the end of the age,1.0
23962,Jesus answered them Be careful that no one leads you astray,1.0
23964,You will hear of wars and rumors of wars See that you arent troubled for all this must happen but the end is not yet,1.0
23965,For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines plagues and earthquakes in various places,1.0
23966,But all these things are the beginning of birth pains,1.0
23968,Then many will stumble and will deliver up one another and will hate one another,1.0
23969,Many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray,1.0
23970,Because iniquity will be multiplied the love of many will grow cold,1.0
23971,But he who endures to the end the same will be saved,1.0
23972,This Gospel of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations and then the end will come,1.0
23974,then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,1.0
23975,Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house,1.0
23977,But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!,1.0
23981,Then if any man tells you Behold here is the Christ or There dont believe it,1.0
23982,For there will arise false christs and false prophets and they will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray if possible even the chosen ones,1.0
23983,Behold I have told you beforehand,1.0
23984,If therefore they tell you Behold he is in the wilderness dont go out Behold he is in the inner chambers dont believe it,1.0
23985,For as the lightning comes forth from the east and is seen even to the west so will be the coming of the Son of Man,1.0
23987,But immediately after the oppression of those days the sun will be darkened the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken,1.0
23988,and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory,1.0
23989,He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds from one end of the sky to the other,1.0
23990,Now from the fig tree learn this parable When its branch has now become tender and puts forth its leaves you know that the summer is near,1.0
23997,and they didnt know until the flood came and took them all away so will be the coming of the Son of Man,1.0
23998,Then two men will be in the field one will be taken and one will be left,1.0
23999,two women grinding at the mill one will be taken and one will be left,1.0
24002,Therefore also be ready for in an hour that you dont expect the Son of Man will come,1.0
24006,But if that evil servant should say in his heart My lord is delaying his coming,1.0
24007,and begins to beat his fellowservants and eat and drink with the drunken,1.0
24012,Those who were foolish when they took their lamps took no oil with them,1.0
24017,The foolish said to the wise Give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out,1.0
24018,But the wise answered saying What if there isnt enough for us and you You go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves,1.0
24019,While they went away to buy the bridegroom came and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut,1.0
24020,Afterward the other virgins also came saying Lord Lord open to us,1.0
24021,But he answered Most assuredly I tell you I dont know you,1.0
24022,Watch therefore for you dont know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming,1.0
24025,Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them and made another five talents,1.0
24026,In like manner he also who got the two gained another two,1.0
24028,Now after a long time the lord of those servants came and reconciled accounts with them,1.0
24030,His lord said to him Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful over a few things I will set you over many things Enter into the joy of your lord,1.0
24033,He also who had received the one talent came and said Lord I knew you that you are a hard man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter,1.0
24035,But his lord answered him You wicked and slothful servant You knew that I reap where I didnt sow and gather where I didnt scatter,1.0
24037,Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents,1.0
24038,For to everyone who has will be given and he will have abundance but from him who has not even that which he has will be taken away,1.0
24042,He will set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left,1.0
24044,for I was hungry and you gave me food to eat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in,1.0
24045,naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came to me,1.0
24046,Then the righteous will answer him saying Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you a drink,1.0
24048,When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you,1.0
24049,The King will answer them Most assuredly I tell you inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers{The word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} you did it to me,1.0
24050,Then he will say also to those on the left hand Depart from me you cursed into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels,1.0
24052,I was a stranger and you didnt take me in naked and you didnt clothe me sick and in prison and you didnt visit me,1.0
24053,Then they will also answer saying Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and didnt help you,1.0
24057,You know that after two days the Passover is coming and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified,1.0
24059,They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit and kill him,1.0
24063,But when his disciples saw this they were indignant saying Why this waste,1.0
24064,For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor,1.0
24065,But Jesus knowing this said to them Why do you trouble the woman Because she has done a good work for me,1.0
24068,Most assuredly I tell you wherever this Gospel is preached in the whole world what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her,1.0
24070,and said What are you willing to give me that I should deliver him to you They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver,1.0
24072,Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus saying to him Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover,1.0
24074,The disciples did as Jesus commanded them and they prepared the Passover,1.0
24075,Now when evening had come he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples,1.0
24081,As they were eating Jesus took bread gave thanks for{TR reads blessed instead of gave thanks for} it and broke it He gave to the disciples and said Take eat this is my body,1.0
24083,for this is my blood of the new covenant which is poured out for many for the remission of sins,1.0
24084,But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Fathers Kingdom,1.0
24085,When they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives,1.0
24086,Then Jesus said to them All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered,1.0
24087,But after I am raised up I will go before you into Galilee,1.0
24089,Jesus said to him Most assuredly I tell you that tonight before the rooster crows you will deny me three times,1.0
24092,He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled,1.0
24093,Then he said to them My soul is exceedingly sorrowful even to death Stay here and watch with me,1.0
24094,He went forward a little fell on his face and prayed saying My Father if it is possible let this cup pass away from me nevertheless not what I desire but what you desire,1.0
24095,He came to the disciples and found them sleeping and said to Peter What couldnt you watch with me for one hour,1.0
24096,Watch and pray that you dont enter into temptation The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,1.0
24098,He came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy,1.0
24099,He left them again went away and prayed a third time saying the same words,1.0
24101,Arise lets be going Behold he who betrays me is at hand,1.0
24102,While he was still speaking behold Judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priest and elders of the people,1.0
24107,Then Jesus said to him Put your sword back into its place for all those who take the sword will die by the sword,1.0
24108,Or do you think that I couldnt ask my Father and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels,1.0
24110,In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me I sat daily in the temple teaching and you didnt arrest me,1.0
24113,But Peter followed him from a distance to the court of the high priest and entered in and sat with the officers to see the end,1.0
24115,and they found none Even though many false witnesses came forward they found none But at last two false witnesses came forward,1.0
24117,The high priest stood up and said to him Have you no answer What is this that these testify against you,1.0
24118,But Jesus held his peace The high priest answered him I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God,1.0
24119,Jesus said to him You have said it Nevertheless I tell you henceforth you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of the sky,1.0
24121,What do you think They answered He is worthy of death!,1.0
24122,Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists and some slapped him,1.0
24123,saying Prophesy to us you Christ! Who hit you,1.0
24124,Now Peter was sitting outside in the court and a maid came to him saying You were also with Jesus the Galilean!,1.0
24126,When he had gone out onto the porch someone else saw him and said to those who were there This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth,1.0
24130,Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times He went out and wept bitterly,1.0
24131,Now when morning had come all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death,1.0
24132,and they bound him and led him away and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate the governor,1.0
24134,saying I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood But they said What is that to us You see to it,1.0
24136,The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said Its not lawful to put them into the treasury since it is the price of blood,1.0
24137,They took counsel and bought the potters field with them to bury strangers in,1.0
24139,Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled saying They took the thirty pieces of silver The price of him upon whom a price had been set Whom some of the children of Israel priced,1.0
24140,And they gave them for the potters field As the Lord commanded me,1.0
24142,When he was accused by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing,1.0
24143,Then Pilate said to him Dont you hear how many things they testify against you,1.0
24145,Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they desired,1.0
24146,They had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas,1.0
24147,When therefore they were gathered together Pilate said to them Whom do you want me to release to you Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ,1.0
24148,For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up,1.0
24150,Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus,1.0
24151,But the governor answered them Which of the two do you want me to release to you They said Barabbas!,1.0
24154,So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained but rather that a disturbance was starting he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person You see to it,1.0
24156,Then he released to them Barabbas but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified,1.0
24157,Then the governors soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison together against him,1.0
24158,They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,1.0
24159,They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and a reed in his right hand and they kneeled down before him and mocked him saying Hail King of the Jews!,1.0
24162,As they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name and they compelled him to go with them that he might carry his cross,1.0
24163,They came to a place called Golgotha that is to say The place of a skull,1.0
24164,They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall When he had tasted it he would not drink,1.0
24165,When they had crucified him they divided his clothing among them casting lots{TR adds that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet They divided my garments among them and for my clothing they cast lots [see Psalm 2218 and John 1924]},1.0
24167,They set up over his head the accusation against him written THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS,1.0
24169,Those who passed by blasphemed him wagging their heads,1.0
24170,and saying You who destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself! If you are the Son of God come down from the cross!,1.0
24172,He saved others but he cant save himself If he is the King of Israel let him come down from the cross now and we will believe in him,1.0
24173,He trusts in God Let God deliver him now if he wants him for he said I am the Son of God,1.0
24175,Now from the sixth hour{noon} there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour{300 P M},1.0
24181,Behold the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom The earth quaked and the rocks were split,1.0
24182,The tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,1.0
24183,and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared to many,1.0
24185,Many women were there watching from afar who had followed Jesus from Galilee serving him,1.0
24186,Among them were Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee,1.0
24187,When evening had come a rich man from Arimathaea named Joseph who himself was also Jesus disciple came,1.0
24190,and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed,1.0
24192,Now on the next day which was the day after the Preparation Day the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,1.0
24193,saying Sir we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive After three days I will rise again,1.0
24194,Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away and tell the people He is risen from the dead and the last deception will be worse than the first,1.0
24195,Pilate said to them You have a guard Go make it as secure as you can,1.0
24196,So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure sealing the stone,1.0
24197,Now after the Sabbath as it began to dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb,1.0
24198,Behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it,1.0
24199,His appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow,1.0
24201,The angel answered the women Dont be afraid for I know that you seek Jesus who has been crucified,1.0
24202,He is not here for he has risen just like he said Come see the place where the Lord was lying,1.0
24203,Go quickly and tell his disciples He has risen from the dead and behold he goes before you into Galilee there you will see him Behold I have told you,1.0
24204,They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to bring his disciples word,1.0
24206,Then Jesus said to them Dont be afraid Go tell my brothers{The word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} that they should go into Galilee and there they will see me,1.0
24207,Now while they were going behold some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened,1.0
24209,saying Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept,1.0
24215,Therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,1.0
24216,teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you Behold I am with you always even to the end of the age Amen,1.0
24218,As it is written in the prophets Behold I send my messenger before your face Who will prepare your way before you,1.0
24219,The voice of one crying in the wilderness Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!,1.0
24220,John came baptizing{To baptize means to immerse in or wash with water or fire This baptizm is not just to cleanse the body but as an outward sign of an inward spiritual cleansing and commitment} in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,1.0
24224,I baptized you in{The Greek word en translated here as in could also be translated as with in some contexts} water but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit,1.0
24227,A voice came out of the sky You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,1.0
24228,Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness,1.0
24229,He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan He was with the wild animals and the angels were ministering to him,1.0
24236,Immediately he called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after him,1.0
24237,They went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught,1.0
24241,Jesus rebuked him saying Be quiet and come out of him!,1.0
24243,They were all amazed so that they questioned among themselves saying What is this A new teaching For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him!,1.0
24245,Immediately when they had come out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John,1.0
24247,He came and took her by the hand and raised her up The fever left her and she served them,1.0
24249,All the city was gathered together at the door,1.0
24251,Early in the night he rose up and went out and departed into a deserted place and prayed there,1.0
24252,Simon and those who were with him followed after him,1.0
24253,and they found him and told him Everyone is looking for you,1.0
24255,He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee preaching and casting out demons,1.0
24256,There came to him a leper begging him kneeling down to him and saying to him If you want to you can make me clean,1.0
24258,When he had said this immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean,1.0
24260,and said to him See you say nothing to anybody but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded for a testimony to them,1.0
24261,But he went out and began to proclaim it much and to spread about the matter so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city but was outside in desert places and they came to him from everywhere,1.0
24262,When he entered again into Capernaum after some days it was heard that he was in the house,1.0
24264,Four people came carrying a paralytic to him,1.0
24266,Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic Son your sins are forgiven you,1.0
24267,But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,1.0
24269,Immediately Jesus perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves said to them Why do you reason these things in your hearts,1.0
24271,But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralytic,1.0
24274,He went out again by the seaside All the multitude came to him and he taught them,1.0
24277,The scribes and the Pharisees when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors said to his disciples Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners,1.0
24278,When Jesus heard it he said to them Those who are healthy have no need for a physician but those who are sick I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance,1.0
24279,Johns disciples and the Pharisees were fasting and they came and asked him Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast but your disciples dont fast,1.0
24281,But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then will they fast in that day,1.0
24283,No one puts new wine into old wineskins or else the new wine will burst the skins and the wine pours out and the skins will be destroyed but they put new wine into fresh wineskins,1.0
24284,It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of grain,1.0
24285,The Pharisees said to him Behold why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day,1.0
24287,How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the show bread which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests and gave also to those who were with him,1.0
24288,He said to them The Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath,1.0
24290,He entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there who had his hand withered,1.0
24293,He said to them Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do harm To save a life or to kill But they were silent,1.0
24294,When he had looked around at them with anger being grieved at the hardening of their hearts he said to the man Stretch out your hand He stretched it out and his hand was restored as healthy as the other,1.0
24295,The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him how they might destroy him,1.0
24296,Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples and a great multitude followed him from Galilee from Judea,1.0
24297,from Jerusalem from Idumaea beyond the Jordan and those from around Tyre and Sidon A great multitude hearing what great things he did came to him,1.0
24298,He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd so that they wouldnt press on him,1.0
24299,For he had healed many so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him,1.0
24300,The unclean spirits whenever they saw him fell down before him and cried You are the Son of God!,1.0
24302,He went up into the mountain and called to himself those whom he wanted and they went to him,1.0
24303,He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach,1.0
24304,and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons,1.0
24305,Simon to whom he gave the name Peter,1.0
24306,James the son of Zebedee John the brother of James and he surnamed them Boanerges which means Sons of Thunder,1.0
24308,and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him He came into a house,1.0
24309,The multitude came together again so that they could not so much as eat bread,1.0
24310,When his friends heard it they went out to seize him for they said He is insane,1.0
24311,The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said He has Beelzebul and By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons,1.0
24313,If a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand,1.0
24316,But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder unless he first binds the strong man and then he will plunder his house,1.0
24318,but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin,1.0
24320,His mother and his brothers came and standing outside they sent to him calling him,1.0
24321,A multitude was sitting around him and they told him Behold your mother your brothers and your sisters{TR omits your sisters} are outside looking for you,1.0
24322,He answered them Who are my mother and my brothers,1.0
24324,For whoever does the will of God the same is my brother and my sister and mother,1.0
24326,He taught them many things in parables and told them in his teaching,1.0
24327,Listen! Behold the farmer went out to sow,1.0
24328,and it happened as he sowed some seed fell by the road and the birds{TR adds of the air} came and devoured it,1.0
24329,Others fell on the rocky ground where it had little soil and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil,1.0
24330,When the sun had risen it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away,1.0
24333,He said Whoever has ears to hear let him hear,1.0
24334,When he was alone those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables,1.0
24337,He said to them Dont you understand this parable How will you understand all of the parables,1.0
24338,The farmer sows the word,1.0
24341,They have no root in themselves but are shortlived When oppression or persecution arises because of the word immediately they stumble,1.0
24343,and the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful,1.0
24344,These are those which were sown on the good ground such as hear the word and accept it and bear fruit some thirty times some sixty times and some one hundred times,1.0
24348,He said to them Take heed what you hear With whatever measure you measure it will be measured to you and more will be given to you who hear,1.0
24351,and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring up and grow he doesnt know how,1.0
24356,yet when it is sown grows up and becomes greater than all the herbs and puts out great branches so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow,1.0
24357,With many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it,1.0
24358,Without a parable he didnt speak to them but privately to his own disciples he explained all things,1.0
24360,Leaving the multitude they took him with them even as he was in the boat Other small boats were also with him,1.0
24362,He himself was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they woke him up and told him Teacher dont you care that we are dying,1.0
24363,He awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea Peace! Be still! The wind ceased and there was a great calm,1.0
24365,They were greatly afraid and said to one another Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him,1.0
24367,When he had come out of the boat immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,1.0
24368,who had his dwelling in the tombs Nobody could bind him any more not even with chains,1.0
24369,because he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been torn apart by him and the fetters broken in pieces Nobody had the strength to tame him,1.0
24373,For he said to him Come out of the man you unclean spirit!,1.0
24374,He asked him What is your name He said to him My name is Legion for we are many,1.0
24376,Now there was on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding,1.0
24377,All the demons begged him saying Send us into the pigs that we may enter into them,1.0
24378,At once Jesus gave them permission The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and they were drowned in the sea,1.0
24379,Those who fed them fled and told it in the city and in the country The people came to see what it was that had happened,1.0
24381,Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons and about the pigs,1.0
24382,They began to beg him to depart from their region,1.0
24383,As he was entering into the boat he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him,1.0
24384,He didnt allow him but said to him Go to your house to your friends and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you,1.0
24385,He went his way and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him and everyone marveled,1.0
24386,When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side a great multitude was gathered to him and he was by the sea,1.0
24388,and begged him much saying My little daughter is at the point of death Please come and lay your hands on her that she may be made healthy and live,1.0
24390,A certain woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years,1.0
24391,and had suffered many things by many physicians and had spent all that she had and was no better but rather grew worse,1.0
24392,having heard the things concerning Jesus came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes,1.0
24393,For she said If I just touch his clothes I will be made well,1.0
24395,Immediately Jesus perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him turned around in the crowd and asked Who touched my clothes,1.0
24396,His disciples said to him You see the multitude pressing against you and you say Who touched me,1.0
24399,He said to her Daughter your faith has made you well Go in peace and be cured of your disease,1.0
24400,While he was still speaking they came from the synagogue rulers house saying Your daughter is dead Why bother the Teacher any more,1.0
24401,But Jesus when he heard the message spoken immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue Dont be afraid only believe,1.0
24402,He allowed no one to follow him except Peter James and John the brother of James,1.0
24403,He came to the synagogue rulers house and he saw an uproar weeping and great wailing,1.0
24404,When he had entered in he said to them Why do you make an uproar and weep The child is not dead but is asleep,1.0
24406,Taking the child by the hand he said to her Talitha cumi which means being interpreted Girl I tell you get up,1.0
24410,When the Sabbath had come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying Where did this man get these things and What is the wisdom that is given to this man that such mighty works come about by his hands,1.0
24411,Isnt this the carpenter the son of Mary and brother of James Joses Judas and Simon Arent his sisters here with us They were offended at him,1.0
24412,Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own relatives and in his own house,1.0
24413,He could do no mighty work there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them,1.0
24415,He called to himself the twelve and began to send them out two by two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits,1.0
24416,He charged them that they should take nothing for their journey except a staff only no bread no wallet no money in their purse,1.0
24418,He said to them Wherever you enter into a house stay there until you depart from there,1.0
24419,Whoever will not receive you nor hear you as you depart from there shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them Assuredly I tell you it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!,1.0
24421,They cast out many demons and anointed many with oil who were sick and healed them,1.0
24423,But others said It is Elijah Others said It is the Prophet or like one of the prophets,1.0
24427,Herodias set herself against him and desired to kill him but she couldnt,1.0
24428,for Herod feared John knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and kept him safe When he heard him he did many things and he heard him gladly,1.0
24429,Then a convenient day came that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles the high officers and the chief men of Galilee,1.0
24431,He swore to her Whatever you shall ask of me I will give you up to half of my kingdom,1.0
24433,She came in immediately with haste to the king and asked I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter,1.0
24434,The king was exceedingly sorry but for the sake of his oaths and of his dinner guests he didnt wish to refuse her,1.0
24435,Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring Johns head and he went and beheaded him in the prison,1.0
24437,When his disciples heard this they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb,1.0
24438,The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus and they told him all things whatever they had done and whatever they had taught,1.0
24439,He said to them You come apart into a deserted place and rest awhile For there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat,1.0
24440,They went away in the boat to a desert place by themselves,1.0
24441,They{TR reads The multitudes instead of They} saw them going and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities They arrived before them and came together to him,1.0
24442,Jesus came out saw a great multitude and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd and he began to teach them many things,1.0
24443,When it was late in the day his disciples came to him and said This place is deserted and it is late in the day,1.0
24445,But he answered them You give them something to eat They asked him Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii{200 denarii was about 7 or 8 months wages for an agricultural laborer} worth of bread and give them something to eat,1.0
24446,He said to them How many loaves do you have Go see When they knew they said Five and two fish,1.0
24447,He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass,1.0
24448,They sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties,1.0
24449,He took the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he blessed and broke the loaves and he gave to his disciples to set before them and he divided the two fish among them all,1.0
24450,They all ate and were filled,1.0
24451,They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish,1.0
24452,Those who ate the loaves were{TR adds about} five thousand men,1.0
24455,When evening had come the boat was in the midst of the sea and he was alone on the land,1.0
24457,but they when they saw him walking on the sea supposed that it was a ghost and cried out,1.0
24461,When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore,1.0
24463,and ran around that whole region and began to bring those who were sick on their mats to where they heard he was,1.0
24464,Wherever he entered into villages or into cities or into the country they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment and as many as touched him were made well,1.0
24465,Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him having come from Jerusalem,1.0
24466,Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled that is unwashed hands they found fault,1.0
24467,For the Pharisees and all the Jews dont eat unless they wash their hands and forearms holding to the tradition of the elders,1.0
24470,He answered them Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written This people honors me with their lips But their heart is far from me,1.0
24473,He said to them Full well do you reject the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition,1.0
24475,But you say If a man tells his father or his mother Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban{Corban is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God} that is to say given to God,1.0
24476,then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,1.0
24477,making void the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down You do many things like this,1.0
24478,He called all the multitude to himself and said to them Hear me all of you and understand,1.0
24480,If anyone has ears to hear let him hear!,1.0
24483,because it doesnt go into his heart but into his stomach then into the latrine thus making all foods clean,1.0
24486,covetings wickedness deceit lustful desires an evil eye blasphemy pride and foolishness,1.0
24488,From there he arose and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon He entered into a house and didnt want anyone to know it but he couldnt escape notice,1.0
24490,Now the woman was a Greek a Syrophoenician by race She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter,1.0
24491,But Jesus said to her Let the children be filled first for it is not appropriate to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs,1.0
24492,But she answered him Yes Lord Yet even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs,1.0
24493,He said to her For this saying go your way The demon has gone out of your daughter,1.0
24494,She went away to her house and found the child having been laid on the bed with the demon gone out,1.0
24499,Immediately his ears were opened and the impediment of his tongue was released and he spoke clearly,1.0
24500,He commanded them that they should tell no one but the more he commanded them so much the more widely they proclaimed it,1.0
24502,In those days when there was a very great multitude and they had nothing to eat Jesus called his disciples to himself and said to them,1.0
24504,If I send them away fasting to their home they will faint on the way for some of them have come a long way,1.0
24505,His disciples answered him From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place,1.0
24506,He asked them How many loaves do you have They said Seven,1.0
24507,He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves Having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to serve and they served the multitude,1.0
24508,They had a few small fish Having blessed them he said to serve these also,1.0
24509,They ate and were filled They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over,1.0
24510,Those who had eaten were about four thousand Then he sent them away,1.0
24511,Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha,1.0
24512,The Pharisees came out and began to question him seeking from him a sign from heaven and testing him,1.0
24513,He sighed deeply in his spirit and said Why does this generation{The word translated generation here genea could also be translated people race or family} seek a sign Most assuredly I tell you no sign will be given to this generation,1.0
24514,He left them and again entering into the boat departed to the other side,1.0
24515,They forgot to take bread and they didnt have more than one loaf in the boat with them,1.0
24516,He charged them saying Take heed beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod,1.0
24518,Jesus perceiving it said to them Why do you reason that its because you have no bread Dont you perceive yet neither understand Is your heart still hardened,1.0
24520,When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up They told him Twelve,1.0
24522,He asked them Dont you understand yet,1.0
24523,He came to Bethsaida They brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him,1.0
24525,He looked up and said I see men for I see them like trees walking,1.0
24527,He sent him away to his house saying Dont enter into the village nor tell anyone in the village,1.0
24528,Jesus went out with his disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi On the way he asked his disciples Who do men say that I am,1.0
24529,They told him John the Baptizer and others say Elijah but others one of the prophets,1.0
24530,He said to them But who do you say that I am Peter answered You are the Christ,1.0
24531,He charged them that they should tell no one about him,1.0
24532,He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again,1.0
24533,He spoke to them openly Peter took him and began to rebuke him,1.0
24534,But he turning around and seeing his disciples rebuked Peter and said Get behind me Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God but the things of men,1.0
24535,He called the multitude to himself with his disciples and said to them Whoever wants to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me,1.0
24536,For whoever wants to save his life will lose it and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the Gospels will save it,1.0
24537,For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life,1.0
24538,For what will a man give in exchange for his life,1.0
24539,For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels,1.0
24540,He said to them Most assuredly I tell you there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power,1.0
24542,His clothing became glistening exceedingly white like snow such as no launderer on earth can whiten them,1.0
24543,Elijah and Moses appeared to them and they were talking with Jesus,1.0
24545,For he didnt know what to say for they were very afraid,1.0
24546,A cloud came overshadowing them and a voice came out of the cloud This is my beloved Son Listen to him,1.0
24548,As they were coming down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no one what things they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead,1.0
24549,They kept this saying to themselves questioning what the rising from the dead meant,1.0
24550,They asked him saying Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first,1.0
24551,He said to them Elijah indeed comes first and restores all things How is it written about the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be despised,1.0
24555,He asked the scribes What are you asking them,1.0
24556,One of the multitude answered Teacher I brought to you my son who has a mute spirit,1.0
24557,and wherever it seizes him it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and wastes away I asked your disciples to cast it out and they werent able,1.0
24558,He answered him Unbelieving generation how long shall I be with you How long shall I bear with you Bring him to me,1.0
24559,They brought him to him and when he saw him immediately the spirit convulsed him and he fell on the ground wallowing and foaming at the mouth,1.0
24560,He asked his father How long has it been since this has come to him He said From childhood,1.0
24561,Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him But if you can do anything have compassion on us and help us,1.0
24563,Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears I believe Help my unbelief!,1.0
24564,When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together he rebuked the unclean spirit saying to him You mute and deaf spirit I command you come out of him and never enter him again!,1.0
24565,Having cried out and convulsed greatly it came out of him The boy became like one dead so much that most of them said He is dead,1.0
24566,But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up and he arose,1.0
24567,When he had come into the house his disciples asked him privately Why couldnt we cast it out,1.0
24570,For he was teaching his disciples and said to them The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men and they will kill him and when he is killed on the third day he will rise again,1.0
24571,But they didnt understand the saying and were afraid to ask him,1.0
24572,He came to Capernaum and when he was in the house he asked them What were you arguing among yourselves on the way,1.0
24573,But they were silent for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest,1.0
24574,He sat down and called the twelve and he said to them If any man wants to be first he shall be last of all and servant of all,1.0
24575,He took a little child and set him in the midst of them Taking him in his arms he said to them,1.0
24576,Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me and whoever receives me doesnt receive me but him who sent me,1.0
24579,For whoever is not against us is on our side,1.0
24580,For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christs most assuredly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward,1.0
24581,Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble it would be better for him if he was thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck,1.0
24582,If your hand causes you to stumble cut it off It is better for you to enter into life maimed rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna{Gehenna is a word for Hell that originated as the name for a place where live babies were thrown crying into the fire under the arms of the idol Moloch to die This place was so despised by the people after the righteous King Josiah abolished this hideous practice that not only was it made into a garbage heap but dead bodies of diseased animals and executed criminals were thrown there and burned} into the unquenchable fire,1.0
24584,If your foot causes you to stumble cut it off It is better for you to enter into life lame rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna into the fire that will never be quenched,1.0
24586,If your eye causes you to stumble cast it out It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire,1.0
24587,where their worm doesnt die and the fire is not quenched,1.0
24589,Salt is good but if the salt has lost its saltiness with what will you season it Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another,1.0
24590,He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan Multitudes came together to him again As he usually did he was again teaching them,1.0
24592,He answered What did Moses command you,1.0
24595,But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female,1.0
24597,and the two will become one flesh so that they are no longer two but one flesh,1.0
24601,If a woman herself divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery,1.0
24603,But when Jesus saw it he was moved with indignation and said to them Allow the little children to come to me! Dont forbid them for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these,1.0
24604,Most assuredly I tell you whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child he will in no way enter into it,1.0
24606,As he was going out into the way one ran to him knelt before him and asked him Good Teacher what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life,1.0
24608,You know the commandments Do not murder Do not commit adultery Do not steal Do not give false testimony Do not defraud Honor your father and mother,1.0
24609,He said to him Teacher I have observed all these things from my youth,1.0
24611,But his face fell at that saying and he went away sorrowful for he was one who had great possessions,1.0
24612,Jesus looked around and said to his disciples How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!,1.0
24615,They were exceedingly astonished saying to him Then who can be saved,1.0
24618,Jesus said Most assuredly I tell you there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or land for my sake and for the Gospels sake,1.0
24619,but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time houses brothers sisters mothers children and land with persecutions and in the age to come eternal life,1.0
24620,But many who are first will be last and the last first,1.0
24621,They were on the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus was going in front of them and they were amazed and those who followed were afraid He again took the twelve and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him,1.0
24622,Behold we are going up to Jerusalem The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes They will condemn him to death and will deliver him to the Gentiles,1.0
24623,They will mock him spit on him scourge him and kill him On the third day he will rise again,1.0
24624,James and John the sons of Zebedee came near to him saying Teacher we want you to do for us whatever we will ask,1.0
24627,But Jesus said to them You dont know what you are asking Are you able to drink the cup that I drink and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,1.0
24629,but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give but for whom it has been prepared,1.0
24630,When the ten heard it they began to be indignant towards James and John,1.0
24632,But it shall not be so among you but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant,1.0
24635,They came to Jericho As he went out from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude the son of Timaeus Bartimaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the road,1.0
24638,Jesus stood still and said Call him They called the blind man saying to him Cheer up! Get up He is calling you!,1.0
24639,He casting away his cloak sprang up and came to Jesus,1.0
24640,Jesus asked him What do you want me to do for you The blind man said to him Rhabboni{Rhabboni is a transliteration of the Hebrew word for great teacher} that I may see again,1.0
24641,Jesus said to him Go your way Your faith has made you well Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way,1.0
24642,When they drew near to Jerusalem to Bethsphage{TR reads Bethphage instead of Bethsphage} and Bethany at the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples,1.0
24643,and said to them Go your way into the village that is opposite you Immediately as you enter into it you will find a young donkey tied on which no one has sat Untie him and bring him,1.0
24644,If anyone asks you Why are you doing this say The Lord needs him and immediately he will send him back here,1.0
24645,They went away and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street and they untied him,1.0
24646,Some of those who stood there asked them What are you doing untying the young donkey,1.0
24647,They said to them just as Jesus had said and they let them go,1.0
24648,They brought the young donkey to Jesus and threw their garments on it and Jesus sat on it,1.0
24649,Many spread their garments on the way and others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road,1.0
24651,Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!,1.0
24653,The next day when they had come out from Bethany he was hungry,1.0
24654,Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it When he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs,1.0
24655,Jesus told it May no one ever eat fruit from you again! and his disciples heard it,1.0
24656,They came to Jerusalem and Jesus entered into the temple and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold the doves,1.0
24657,He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple,1.0
24660,When evening came he went out of the city,1.0
24661,As they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots,1.0
24662,Peter remembering said to him Rabbi look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away,1.0
24664,For most assuredly I tell you whoever may tell this mountain Be taken up and cast into the sea and doesnt doubt in his heart but believes that what he says is happening he shall have whatever he says,1.0
24665,Therefore I tell you all things whatever you pray and ask for believe that you receive them and you shall have them,1.0
24667,But if you do not forgive neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions,1.0
24671,The baptism of John  was it from heaven or from men Answer me,1.0
24672,They reasoned with themselves saying If we should say From heaven he will say Why then did you not believe him,1.0
24675,He began to speak to them in parables A man planted a vineyard put a hedge around it dug a pit for the winepress built a tower rented it out to a farmer and went into another country,1.0
24676,When it was time he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard,1.0
24680,Therefore still having one his beloved son he sent him last to them saying They will respect my son,1.0
24681,But those farmers said among themselves This is the heir Come lets kill him and the inheritance will be ours,1.0
24682,They took him killed him and cast him out of the vineyard,1.0
24686,They tried to seize him but they feared the multitude for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them They left him and went away,1.0
24688,When they had come they asked him Teacher we know that you are honest and dont defer to anyone for you arent partial to anyone but truly teach the way of God Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not,1.0
24689,Shall we give or shall we not give But he knowing their hypocrisy said to them Why do you test me Bring me a denarius that I may see it,1.0
24690,They brought it He said to them Whose is this image and inscription They said to him Caesars,1.0
24691,Jesus answered them Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are Gods They marveled greatly at him,1.0
24693,Teacher Moses wrote to us If a mans brother dies and leaves a wife behind him and leaves no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother,1.0
24694,There were seven brothers The first took a wife and dying left no offspring,1.0
24695,The second took her and died leaving no children behind him The third likewise,1.0
24696,and the seven took her and left no children Last of all the woman also died,1.0
24700,But about the dead that they are raised havent you read in the book of Moses about the Bush how God spoke to him saying I am the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,1.0
24701,He is not the God of the dead but of the living You are therefore badly mistaken,1.0
24702,One of the scribes came and heard them questioning together Knowing that he had answered them well asked him Which commandment is the greatest of all,1.0
24703,Jesus answered The greatest is Hear Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one,1.0
24705,The second is like this You shall love your neighbor as yourself There is no other commandment greater than these,1.0
24708,When Jesus saw that he answered wisely he said to him You are not far from the Kingdom of God No one dared ask him any question after that,1.0
24709,Jesus responded as he taught in the temple How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David,1.0
24710,For David himself said in the Holy Spirit The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet,1.0
24711,Therefore David himself calls him Lord so how can he be his son The common people heard him gladly,1.0
24712,In his teaching he said to them Beware of the scribes who like to walk in long robes and to get greetings in the marketplaces,1.0
24713,and the best seats in the synagogues and the best places at feasts,1.0
24716,A poor widow came and she cast in two small brass coins{Literally lepta or widows mites Lepta are very small brass coins worth half a quadrans each which is a quarter of the copper assarion Lepta are worth less than 1 of an agricultural workers daily wages} which equal a quadrans coin{A quadrans is a coin worth about 164 of a denarius A denarius is about one days wages for an agricultural laborer},1.0
24717,He called his disciples to himself and said to them Most assuredly I tell you this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,1.0
24718,for they all gave out of their abundance but she out of her poverty gave all that she had to live on,1.0
24721,As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple Peter James John and Andrew asked him privately,1.0
24722,Tell us when will these things be What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled,1.0
24724,For many will come in my name saying I am he!{Literally I AM!} and will lead many astray,1.0
24725,When you hear of wars and rumors of wars dont be troubled For those must happen but the end is not yet,1.0
24727,But watch yourselves for they will deliver you up to councils You will be beaten in synagogues You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony to them,1.0
24728,The Gospel must first be preached to all the nations,1.0
24729,When they lead you away and deliver you up dont be anxious beforehand or premeditate what you will say but say whatever will be given you in that hour For it is not you who speak but the Holy Spirit,1.0
24735,But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!,1.0
24738,Unless the Lord had shortened the days no flesh would have been saved but for the sake of the chosen ones whom he picked out he shortened the days,1.0
24740,For there will arise false christs and false prophets and will show signs and wonders that they may lead astray if possible even the chosen ones,1.0
24741,But you watch Behold I have told you all things beforehand,1.0
24742,But in those days after that oppression the sun will be darkened the moon will not give its light,1.0
24744,Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory,1.0
24745,Then he will send out his angels and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky,1.0
24746,Now from the fig tree learn this parable When the branch has now become tender and puts forth its leaves you know that the summer is near,1.0
24748,Most assuredly I say to you this generation{The word translated generation genea could also be translated race family or people} will not pass away until all these things happen,1.0
24749,Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away,1.0
24750,But of that day or that hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but only the Father,1.0
24752,It is like a man traveling to another country having left his house and given authority to his servants and to each one his work and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch,1.0
24754,lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping,1.0
24756,It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might sieze him by deception and kill him,1.0
24759,But there were some who were indignant among themselves saying Why has this ointment been wasted,1.0
24765,Judas Iscariot who was one of the twelve went away to the chief priests that he might deliver him to them,1.0
24768,He sent two of his disciples and said to them Go into the city and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water Follow him,1.0
24769,and wherever he enters in tell the master of the house The Teacher says Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples,1.0
24770,He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready Make ready for us there,1.0
24772,When it was evening he came with the twelve,1.0
24773,As they sat and were eating Jesus said Most assuredly I tell you one of you will betray me  he who eats with me,1.0
24776,For the Son of Man goes even as it is written about him but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born,1.0
24779,He said to them This is my blood of the new covenant which is poured out for many,1.0
24780,Most assuredly I tell you I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God,1.0
24781,When they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives,1.0
24782,Jesus said to them All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered,1.0
24784,But Peter said to him Although all will be offended yet I will not,1.0
24785,Jesus said to him Most assuredly I tell you that you today even this night before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times,1.0
24786,But he spoke all the more If I must die with you I will not deny you They all said the same thing,1.0
24787,They came to a place which was named Gethsemane He said to his disciples Sit here while I pray,1.0
24788,He took with him Peter James and John and began to be greatly troubled and distressed,1.0
24789,He said to them My soul is exceedingly sorrowful even to death Stay here and watch,1.0
24791,He said Abba Father all things are possible to you Please remove this cup from me However not what I desire but what you desire,1.0
24792,He came and found them sleeping and said to Peter Simon are you sleeping Couldnt you watch one hour,1.0
24793,Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,1.0
24794,Again he went away and prayed saying the same words,1.0
24797,Arise let us be going Behold he who betrays me is at hand,1.0
24798,Immediately while he was still speaking Judas one of the twelve cameand with him a multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests the scribes and the elders,1.0
24800,When he had come immediately he came to him and said Rabbi! Rabbi! and kissed him,1.0
24803,Jesus answered them Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me,1.0
24804,I was daily with you in the temple teaching and you didnt arrest me But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled,1.0
24805,They all left him and fled,1.0
24806,A certain young man followed him having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body The young men grabbed him,1.0
24808,They led Jesus away to the high priest All the chief priests the elders and the scribes came together with him,1.0
24809,Peter had followed him from a distance until he came into the court of the high priest He was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light of the fire,1.0
24810,Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death and found none,1.0
24811,For many gave false testimony against him and their testimony didnt agree with each other,1.0
24812,Some stood up and gave false testimony against him saying,1.0
24813,We heard him say I will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days I will build another made without hands,1.0
24815,The high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus Have you no answer What is it which these testify against you,1.0
24816,But he stayed quiet and answered nothing Again the high priest asked him Are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed,1.0
24817,Jesus said I AM You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of the sky,1.0
24820,Some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to beat him with fists and to tell him Prophesy! The officers struck him with the palms of their hands,1.0
24821,As Peter was in the courtyard below one of the maids of the high priest came,1.0
24823,But he denied it saying I neither know nor understand what you are saying He went out on the porch and the rooster crowed,1.0
24825,But he again denied it After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter You truly are one of them for you are a Galilean and your speech shows it,1.0
24826,But he began to curse and to swear I dont know this man of whom you speak!,1.0
24827,The rooster crowed the second time Peter remembered the word how that Jesus said to him Before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times When he thought about that he wept,1.0
24830,The chief priests accused him of many things,1.0
24831,Pilate again asked him Have you no answer See how many things they testify against you!,1.0
24833,Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner whom they asked of him,1.0
24835,The multitude crying aloud began to ask him to do as he always did for them,1.0
24836,Pilate answered them saying Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews,1.0
24840,They cried out again Crucify him!,1.0
24843,The soldiers led him away within the court which is the Praetorium and they called together the whole cohort,1.0
24844,They clothed him with purple and weaving a crown of thorns they put it on him,1.0
24845,They began to salute him Hail King of the Jews!,1.0
24846,They struck his head with a reed and spat on him and bowing their knees did homage to him,1.0
24847,When they had mocked him they took the purple off of him and put his own garments on him They led him out to crucify him,1.0
24848,They compelled one passing by coming from the country Simon of Cyrene the father of Alexander and Rufus to go with them that he might bear his cross,1.0
24853,The superscription of his accusation was written over him THE KING OF THE JEWS,1.0
24855,The Scripture was fulfilled which says He was numbered with transgressors,1.0
24857,save yourself and come down from the cross!,1.0
24858,Likewise also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said He saved others He cant save himself,1.0
24859,Let the Christ the King of Israel now come down from the cross that we may see and believe him{TR omits him} Those who were crucified with him insulted him,1.0
24860,When the sixth hour{or noon} had come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour{300 PM},1.0
24861,At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted My God my God why have you forsaken me,1.0
24862,Some of those who stood by when they heard it said Behold he is calling Elijah,1.0
24863,One ran and filling a sponge full of vinegar put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink saying Let him be Lets see whether Elijah comes to take him down,1.0
24864,Jesus cried out with a loud voice and gave up the spirit,1.0
24866,When the centurion who stood by opposite him saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last he said Truly this man was the Son of God!,1.0
24868,who when he was in Galilee followed him and served him and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem,1.0
24869,When evening had now come because it was the Preparation Day that is the day before the Sabbath,1.0
24870,Joseph of Arimathaea a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God came He boldly went in to Pilate and asked for Jesus body,1.0
24872,When he found out from the centurion he granted the body to Joseph,1.0
24873,He bought a linen cloth and taking him down wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb,1.0
24874,Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid,1.0
24875,When the Sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices that they might come and anoint him,1.0
24876,Very early on the first day of the week they came to the tomb when the sun had risen,1.0
24879,Entering into the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side dressed in a white robe and they were amazed,1.0
24880,He said to them Dont be amazed You seek Jesus the Nazarene who has been crucified He has risen He is not here Behold the place where they laid him!,1.0
24881,But go tell his disciples and Peter He goes before you into Galilee There you will see him as he said to you,1.0
24882,They went out{TR adds quickly} and fled from the tomb for trembling and astonishment had come on them They said nothing to anyone for they were afraid,1.0
24883,Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons,1.0
24884,She went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept,1.0
24885,When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they disbelieved,1.0
24886,After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them as they walked on their way into the country,1.0
24887,They went away and told it to the rest They didnt believe them either,1.0
24888,Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they didnt believe those who had seen him after he had risen,1.0
24889,He said to them Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation,1.0
24890,He who believes and is baptized will be saved but he who disbelieves will be condemned,1.0
24891,These signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will cast out demons they will speak with new languages,1.0
24892,they will take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it will in no way hurt them they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover,1.0
24894,They went out and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed Amen,1.0
24899,There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea a certain priest named Zacharias of the priestly division of Abijah He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth,1.0
24900,They were both righteous before God walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord,1.0
24901,But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren and they both were well advanced in years,1.0
24903,according to the custom of the priests office his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense,1.0
24904,The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense,1.0
24905,An angel of the Lord appeared to him standing on the right side of the altar of incense,1.0
24906,Zacharias was troubled when he saw him and fear fell upon him,1.0
24908,You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth,1.0
24910,He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,1.0
24911,He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord,1.0
24912,Zacharias said to the angel How can I be sure of this For I am an old man and my wife is well advanced in years,1.0
24913,The angel answered him I am Gabriel who stands in the presence of God I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news,1.0
24915,The people were waiting for Zacharias and they marveled that he delayed in the temple,1.0
24916,When he came out he could not speak to them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple He continued making signs to them and remained mute,1.0
24917,It happened when the days of his service were fulfilled he departed to his house,1.0
24919,Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me to take away my reproach among men,1.0
24920,Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,1.0
24922,Having come in the angel said to her Rejoice you highly favored one! The Lord is with you Blessed are you among women!,1.0
24924,The angel said to her Dont be afraid Mary for you have found favor with God,1.0
24925,Behold you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a son and will call his name Jesus,1.0
24926,He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,1.0
24927,and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever There will be no end to his Kingdom,1.0
24928,Mary said to the angel How can this be seeing I am a virgin,1.0
24930,Behold Elizabeth your relative also has conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren,1.0
24932,Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it to me according to your word The angel departed from her,1.0
24933,Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of Judah,1.0
24934,and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth,1.0
24935,It happened when Elizabeth heard Marys greeting that the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,1.0
24936,She called out with a loud voice and said Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!,1.0
24937,Why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me,1.0
24938,For behold when the voice of your greeting came into my ears the baby leaped in my womb for joy!,1.0
24939,Blessed is she who believed for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!,1.0
24940,Mary said My soul magnifies the Lord,1.0
24941,My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,1.0
24943,For he who is mighty has done great things for me Holy is his name,1.0
24945,He has shown strength with his arm He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart,1.0
24946,He has put down princes from their thrones And has exalted the lowly,1.0
24947,He has filled the hungry with good things He has sent the rich away empty,1.0
24948,He has given help to Israel his servant that he might remember mercy,1.0
24949,As he spoke to our fathers To Abraham and his seed forever,1.0
24952,Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her and they rejoiced with her,1.0
24953,It happened on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child and they would have called him Zacharias after the name of the father,1.0
24955,They said to her There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name,1.0
24957,He asked for a writing tablet and wrote His name is John They all marveled,1.0
24963,And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,1.0
24966,To show mercy towards our fathers To remember his holy covenant,1.0
24967,The oath which he spoke to Abraham our father,1.0
24969,In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life,1.0
24970,And you child will be called a prophet of the Most High For you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways,1.0
24971,To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,1.0
24972,Because of the tender mercy of our God Whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,1.0
24973,To shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death To guide our feet into the way of peace,1.0
24975,Now it happened in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled,1.0
24976,This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria,1.0
24979,to enroll himself with Mary who was pledged to be married to him as wife being pregnant,1.0
24980,It happened while they were there that the day had come that she should give birth,1.0
24981,She brought forth her firstborn son and she wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough because there was no room for them in the inn,1.0
24982,There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field and keeping watch by night over their flock,1.0
24984,The angel said to them Dont be afraid for behold I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people,1.0
24986,This is the sign to you you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth lying in a feeding trough,1.0
24987,Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,1.0
24989,It happened when the angels went away from them into the sky that the shepherds said one to another Lets go to Bethlehem now and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us,1.0
24990,They came with haste and found both Mary and Joseph and the baby was lying in the feeding trough,1.0
24991,When they saw it they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child,1.0
24994,The shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen just as it was told them,1.0
24995,When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child his name was called Jesus which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb,1.0
24996,When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,1.0
24999,Behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon This man was righteous and devout looking for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was on him,1.0
25000,It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lords Christ{Christ Greek and Messiah Hebrew both mean Anointed One},1.0
25002,then he received him into his arms and blessed God and said,1.0
25003,Now you are releasing your servant Master According to your word in peace,1.0
25004,For my eyes have seen your salvation,1.0
25005,Which you have prepared before the face of all peoples,1.0
25008,and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother Behold this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel and for a sign which is spoken against,1.0
25010,There was one Anna a prophetess the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher she was of a great age having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,1.0
25012,Coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to the Lord and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem,1.0
25015,His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover,1.0
25017,and when they had fulfilled the days as they were returning the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem Joseph and his mother didnt know it,1.0
25018,but supposing him to be in the company they went a days journey and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances,1.0
25020,It happened after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers both listening to them and asking them questions,1.0
25021,All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers,1.0
25022,When they saw him they were astonished and his mother said to him Son why have you treated us this way Behold your father and I were anxiously looking for you,1.0
25023,He said to them Why were you looking for me Didnt you know that I must be in my Fathers house,1.0
25024,They didnt understand the saying which he spoke to them,1.0
25028,in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness,1.0
25029,He came into all the region around the Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins,1.0
25033,He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him You offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come,1.0
25036,The multitudes asked him What then must we do,1.0
25037,He answered them He who has two coats let him give to him who has none He who has food let him do likewise,1.0
25038,Tax collectors also came to be baptized and they said to him Teacher what must we do,1.0
25039,He said to them Collect no more than that which is appointed to you,1.0
25041,As the people were in expectation and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John whether perhaps he was the Christ,1.0
25042,John answered them all I indeed baptize you with water but he comes who is mightier than I the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,1.0
25043,whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor and will gather the wheat into his barn but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire,1.0
25044,Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,1.0
25047,Now it happened when all the people were baptized Jesus also had been baptized and was praying The sky was opened,1.0
25048,and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him and a voice came out of the sky saying You are my beloved Son In you I am well pleased,1.0

25067,The devil said to him If you are the Son of God command this stone to become bread,1.0
25068,Jesus answered him saying It is written Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God,1.0
25069,The devil leading him up on a high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,1.0
25070,The devil said to him I will give you all this authority and their glory for it has been delivered to me and I give it to whomever I want,1.0
25071,If you therefore will worship before me it will all be yours,1.0
25072,Jesus answered him Get behind me Satan! For it is written You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve,1.0
25073,He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him If you are the Son of God cast yourself down from here,1.0
25075,and On their hands they will bear you up Lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone,1.0
25077,When the devil had completed every temptation he departed from him until another time,1.0

25083,And to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,1.0
25085,He began to tell them Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,1.0
25086,All testified about him and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said Isnt this Josephs son,1.0
25088,He said Most assuredly I tell you no prophet is acceptable in his hometown,1.0
25089,But truly I tell you there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was shut up three years and six months when a great famine came over all the land,1.0
25091,There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet yet not one of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian,1.0
25092,They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things,1.0
25093,They rose up threw him out of the city and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on that they might throw him off the cliff,1.0
25095,He came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,1.0
25098,saying Ah! what have we to do with you Jesus of Nazareth Have you come to destroy us I know you who you are the Holy One of God!,1.0
25099,Jesus rebuked him saying Be silent and come out of him! When the demon had thrown him down in their midst he came out of him having done him no harm,1.0
25100,Amazement came on all and they spoke together one with another saying What is this word For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out!,1.0
25101,News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region,1.0
25102,He rose up from the synagogue and entered into Simons house Simons motherinlaw was afflicted with a great fever and they begged him for her,1.0
25103,He stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her Immediately she rose up and served them,1.0
25104,When the sun was setting all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them,1.0
25105,Demons also came out from many crying out and saying You are the Christ the Son of God! Rebuking them he didnt allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Christ,1.0
25106,When it was day he departed and went into an uninhabited place and the multitudes looked for him and came to him and held on to him so that he wouldnt go away from them,1.0
25110,He saw two boats standing by the lake but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets,1.0
25111,He entered into one of the boats which was Simons and asked him to put out a little from the land He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat,1.0
25113,Simon answered him Master we worked all night and took nothing but at your word I will let down the net,1.0
25114,When they had done this they caught a great multitude of fish and their net was breaking,1.0
25115,They beckoned to their partners in the other boat that they should come and help them They came and filled both boats so that they began to sink,1.0
25116,But Simon Peter when he saw it fell down at Jesus knees saying Depart from me for I am a sinful man Lord,1.0
25118,and so also were James and John sons of Zebedee who were partners with Simon Jesus said to Simon Dont be afraid From now on you will be catching people alive,1.0
25120,It happened while he was in one of the cities behold there was a man full of leprosy When he saw Jesus he fell on his face and begged him saying Lord if you want to you can make me clean,1.0
25121,He stretched out his hand and touched him saying I want to Be made clean Immediately the leprosy left him,1.0
25122,He charged him to tell no one But go your way and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded for a testimony to them,1.0
25123,But the report concerning him spread much more and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities,1.0
25124,But he withdrew himself into the desert and prayed,1.0
25125,It happened on one of those days that he was teaching and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by who had come out of every village of Galilee Judea and Jerusalem The power of the Lord was with him to heal them,1.0
25126,Behold men brought a paralyzed man on a cot and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus,1.0
25127,Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude they went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus,1.0
25128,Seeing their faith he said to him Man your sins are forgiven you,1.0
25129,The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying Who is this that speaks blasphemies Who can forgive sins but God alone,1.0
25130,But Jesus perceiving their thoughts answered them Why are you reasoning so in your hearts,1.0
25131,Which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven you or to say Arise and walk,1.0
25132,But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the paralyzed man I tell you arise and take up your cot and go to your house,1.0
25133,Immediately he rose up before them and took up that which he was laying on and departed to his house glorifying God,1.0
25134,Amazement took hold on all and they glorified God They were filled with fear saying We have seen strange things today,1.0
25135,After these things he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office and said to him Follow me!,1.0
25137,Levi made a great feast for him in his house There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them,1.0
25138,Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples saying Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners,1.0
25143,But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them Then they will fast in those days,1.0
25144,He also told a parable to them No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment or else he will tear the new and also the piece from the new will not match the old,1.0
25145,No one puts new wine into old wineskins or else the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed,1.0
25147,No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new for he says The old is better,1.0
25148,Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first that he was going through the grain fields His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate rubbing them in their hands,1.0
25153,It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught There was a man there and his right hand was withered,1.0
25154,The scribes and the Pharisees watched him to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath that they might find an accusation against him,1.0
25156,Then Jesus said to them I will ask you something Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm To save a life or to kill,1.0
25157,He looked around at them all and said to the man Stretch out your hand He did and his hand was restored as sound as the other,1.0
25159,It happened in these days that he went out to the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to God,1.0
25160,When it was day he called his disciples and from them he chose twelve whom he also named apostles,1.0
25161,Simon whom he also named Peter Andrew his brother James John Philip Bartholomew,1.0
25162,Matthew Thomas James the son of Alphaeus Simon who was called the Zealot,1.0
25163,Judas the son of James and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor,1.0
25165,as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits and they were being healed,1.0
25166,All the multitude sought to touch him for power came out from him and healed them all,1.0
25167,He lifted up his eyes to his disciples and said Blessed are you who are poor For yours is the Kingdom of God,1.0
25168,Blessed are you who hunger now For you will be filled Blessed are you who weep now For you will laugh,1.0
25169,Blessed are you when men shall hate you and when they shall exclude and mock you and throw out your name as evil for the Son of Mans sake,1.0
25171,But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation,1.0
25172,Woe to you you who are full now! For you will be hungry Woe to you who laugh now! For you will mourn and weep,1.0
25173,Woe{TR adds to you} when{TR adds all} men speak well of you! For their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets,1.0
25174,But I tell you who hear love your enemies do good to those who hate you,1.0
25175,bless those who curse you and pray for those who mistreat you,1.0
25177,Give to everyone who asks you and dont ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again,1.0
25178,As you would like people to do to you do exactly so to them,1.0
25179,If you love those who love you what credit is that to you For even sinners love those who love them,1.0
25181,If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what credit is that to you Even sinners lend to sinners to receive back as much,1.0
25184,Dont judge And you wont be judged Dont condemn And you wont be condemned Set free And you will be set free,1.0
25186,He spoke a parable to them Can the blind guide the blind Wont they both fall into a pit,1.0
25187,A disciple is not above his teacher but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher,1.0
25188,Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brothers eye but dont consider the beam that is in your own eye,1.0
25189,Or how can you tell your brother Brother let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye when you yourself dont see the beam that is in your own eye You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brothers eye,1.0
25192,The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks,1.0
25193,Why do you call me Lord Lord and dont do the things which I say,1.0
25194,Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them I will show you who he is like,1.0
25195,He is like a man building a house who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock When a flood arose the stream broke against that house and could not shake it because it was founded on the rock,1.0
25197,After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people he entered into Capernaum,1.0
25198,A certain centurions servant who was dear to him was sick and at the point of death,1.0
25200,When they came to Jesus they begged him earnestly saying He is worthy for you to do this for him,1.0
25201,for he loves our nation and he built our synagogue for us,1.0
25202,Jesus went with them When he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying to him Lord dont trouble yourself for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof,1.0
25205,When Jesus heard these things he marveled at him and turned and said to the multitude who followed him I tell you I have not found such great faith no not in Israel,1.0
25206,Those who were sent returning to the house found that the servant who had been sick was well,1.0
25208,Now when he drew near to the gate of the city behold one who was dead was carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow Many people of the city were with her,1.0
25211,He who was dead sat up and began to speak And he gave him to his mother,1.0
25212,Fear took hold of all and they glorified God saying A great prophet has arisen among us! and God has visited his people!,1.0
25213,This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region,1.0
25214,The disciples of John told him about all these things,1.0
25215,John calling to himself two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying Are you the one who is coming or should we look for another,1.0
25216,When the men had come to him they said John the Baptizer has sent us to you saying Are you he who comes or should we look for another,1.0
25217,In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits and to many who were blind he gave sight,1.0
25218,Jesus answered them Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard that the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them,1.0
25221,But what did you go out to see A man clothed in soft clothing Behold those who are gorgeously dressed and live delicately are in kings courts,1.0
25222,But what did you go out to see A prophet Yes I tell you and much more than a prophet,1.0
25223,This is he of whom it is written Behold I send my messenger before your face Who will prepare your way before you,1.0
25224,For I tell you among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he,1.0
25225,When all the people and the tax collectors heard this they declared God to be just having been baptized with Johns baptism,1.0
25226,But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God not being baptized by him themselves,1.0
25228,They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call one to another saying We piped to you and you didnt dance We mourned and you didnt weep,1.0
25230,The Son of Man has come eating and drinking and you say Behold a gluttonous man and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners!,1.0
25231,Wisdom is justified by all her children,1.0
25235,Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it he said to himself This man if he were a prophet would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him that she is a sinner,1.0
25236,Jesus answered him Simon I have something to tell you He said Teacher say on,1.0
25237,A certain lender had two debtors The one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty,1.0
25238,When they couldnt pay he forgave them both Which of them therefore will love him most,1.0
25242,You didnt anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment,1.0
25245,Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves Who is this who even forgives sins,1.0
25246,He said to the woman Your faith has saved you Go in peace,1.0
25247,It happened soon afterwards that he went about through cities and villages preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God With him were the twelve,1.0
25248,and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary who was called Magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out,1.0
25250,When a great multitude came together and people from every city were coming to him he spoke by a parable,1.0
25251,The farmer went out to sow his seed As he sowed some fell along the road and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the sky devoured it,1.0
25252,Other seed fell on the rock and as soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture,1.0
25253,Other fell amid the thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it,1.0
25254,Other fell into the good ground and grew and brought forth fruit one hundred times As he said these things he called out He who has ears to hear let him hear!,1.0
25255,Then his disciples asked him What does this parable mean,1.0
25256,He said To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God but to the rest in parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand,1.0
25257,Now the parable is this The seed is the word of God,1.0
25258,Those along the road are those who hear then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved,1.0
25261,That in the good ground these are such as in an honest and good heart having heard the word hold it tightly and bring forth fruit with patience,1.0
25262,No one when he has lit a lamp covers it with a container or puts it under a bed but puts it on a stand that those who enter in may see the light,1.0
25264,Be careful therefore how you hear For whoever has to him will be given and whoever doesnt have from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has,1.0
25265,His mother and brothers came to him and they could not come near him for the crowd,1.0
25266,It was told him by some saying Your mother and your brothers stand outside desiring to see you,1.0
25267,But he answered them My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it,1.0
25268,Now it happened on one of those days that he entered into a boat himself and his disciples and he said to them Lets go over to the other side of the lake So they launched out,1.0
25269,But as they sailed he fell asleep A wind storm came down on the lake and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water,1.0
25271,He said to them Where is your faith Being afraid they marveled saying one to another Who is this then that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him,1.0
25272,They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes which is opposite Galilee,1.0
25273,When Jesus stepped ashore a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him He wore no clothes and didnt live in a house but in the tombs,1.0
25274,When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said What do I have to do with you Jesus you Son of the Most High God I beg you dont torment me!,1.0
25276,Jesus asked him What is your name He said Legion for many demons had entered into him,1.0
25277,They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss,1.0
25278,Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those He allowed them,1.0
25281,People went out to see what had happened They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus feet clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid,1.0
25282,Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed,1.0
25284,But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him but Jesus sent him away saying,1.0
25286,It happened when Jesus returned that the multitude welcomed him for they were all waiting for him,1.0
25288,for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age and she was dying But as he went the multitudes pressed against him,1.0
25290,came behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak and immediately the flow of her blood stopped,1.0
25291,Jesus said Who touched me When all denied it Peter and those with him said Master the multitudes press and jostle you and you say Who touched me,1.0
25292,But Jesus said Someone did touch me for I perceived that power has gone out of me,1.0
25294,He said to her Daughter cheer up Your faith has made you well Go in peace,1.0
25295,While he still spoke one from the ruler of the synagogues house came saying to him Your daughter is dead Dont trouble the Teacher,1.0
25296,But Jesus hearing it answered him Dont be afraid Only believe and she will be healed,1.0
25297,When he came to the house he didnt allow anyone to enter in except Peter John James the father of the child and her mother,1.0
25298,All were weeping and mourning her but he said Dont weep She isnt dead but sleeping,1.0
25299,They were ridiculing him knowing that she was dead,1.0
25301,Her spirit returned and she rose up immediately He commanded that something be given to her to eat,1.0
25302,Her parents were amazed but he charged them to tell no one what had been done,1.0
25304,He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick,1.0
25306,Into whatever house you enter stay there and depart from there,1.0
25310,and by some that Elijah had appeared and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again,1.0
25312,The apostles when they had returned told him what things they had done He took them and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida,1.0
25313,But the multitudes perceiving it followed him He welcomed them and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God and he cured those who needed healing,1.0
25314,The day began to wear away and the twelve came and said to him Send the multitude away that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms and lodge and get food for we are here in a deserted place,1.0
25315,But he said to them You give them something to eat They said We have no more than five loaves and two fish unless we should go and buy food for all these people,1.0
25319,They ate and were all filled They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over,1.0
25320,It happened as he was praying alone that the disciples were with him and he asked them Who do the multitudes say that I am,1.0
25321,They answered John the Baptizer but others say Elijah and others that one of the old prophets is risen again,1.0
25324,saying The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third day be raised up,1.0
25325,He said to all If anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself take up his cross{TR NU add daily} and follow me,1.0
25326,For whoever desires to save his life will lose it but whoever will lose his life for my sake the same will save it,1.0
25327,For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits his own self,1.0
25328,For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels,1.0
25329,But I tell you the truth There are some of those who stand here who will in no way taste of death until they see the Kingdom of God,1.0
25331,As he was praying the appearance of his face was altered and his clothing became white and dazzling,1.0
25335,It happened as they were parting from him that Peter said to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here Lets make three tents one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah not knowing what he said,1.0
25337,A voice came out of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son Listen to him!,1.0
25341,Behold a spirit takes him he suddenly cries out and it convulses him so that he foams and it hardly departs from him bruising him severely,1.0
25344,While he was still coming the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father,1.0
25346,Let these words sink into your ears for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men,1.0
25347,But they didnt understand this saying It was concealed from them that they should not perceive it and they were afraid to ask him about this saying,1.0
25350,and said to them Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me Whoever receives me receives him who sent me For whoever is least among you all this one will be great,1.0
25353,It came to pass when the days were near that he should be taken up he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,1.0
25354,and sent messengers before his face They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans so as to prepare for him,1.0
25356,When his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them just as Elijah did,1.0
25359,As they went on the way a certain man said to him I want to follow you wherever you go Lord,1.0
25360,Jesus said to him The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head,1.0
25361,He said to another Follow me! But he said Lord allow me first to go and bury my father,1.0
25363,Another also said I want to follow you Lord but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house,1.0
25365,Now after these things the Lord also appointed seventy others and sent them two by two ahead of him{literally before his face} into every city and place where he was about to come,1.0
25366,Then he said to them The harvest is indeed plentiful but the laborers are few Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest that he may send out laborers into his harvest,1.0
25367,Go your ways Behold I send you out as lambs among wolves,1.0
25368,Carry no purse nor wallet nor sandals Greet no one on the way,1.0
25370,If a son of peace is there your peace will rest on him but if not it will return to you,1.0
25371,Remain in that same house eating and drinking the things they give for the laborer is worthy of his wages Dont go from house to house,1.0
25373,Heal the sick who are therein and tell them The Kingdom of God has come near to you,1.0
25375,Even the dust from your city that clings to us we wipe off against you Nevertheless know this that the Kingdom of God has come near to you,1.0
25377,Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes,1.0
25378,But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you,1.0
25379,You Capernaum who are exalted to heaven will be brought down to Hades{Hades is the lower realm of the dead or Hell},1.0
25380,Whoever listens to you listens to me and whoever rejects you rejects me Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me,1.0
25381,The seventy returned with joy saying Lord even the demons are subject to us in your name!,1.0
25382,He said to them I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven,1.0
25384,Nevertheless dont rejoice in this that the spirits are subject to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven,1.0
25386,Turning to the disciples he said All things have been delivered to me by my Father No one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him,1.0
25387,Turning to the disciples he said privately Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,1.0
25388,for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see and didnt see them and to hear the things which you hear and didnt hear them,1.0
25389,Behold a certain lawyer stood up and tested him saying Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life,1.0
25391,He answered You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself,1.0
25392,He said to him You have answered correctly Do this and you will live,1.0
25393,But he desiring to justify himself asked Jesus Who is my neighbor,1.0
25394,Jesus answered A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among robbers who both stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead,1.0
25395,By chance a certain priest was going down that way When he saw him he passed by on the other side,1.0
25397,But a certain Samaritan as he traveled came where he was When he saw him he was moved with compassion,1.0
25398,came to him and bound up his wounds pouring on oil and wine He set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him,1.0
25400,Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers,1.0
25402,It happened as they went on their way he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house,1.0
25404,But Martha was distracted with much serving and she came up to him and said Lord dont you care that my sister left me to serve alone Ask her therefore to help me,1.0
25405,Jesus answered her Martha Martha you are anxious and troubled about many things,1.0
25406,but one thing is needed Mary has chosen the good part which will not be taken away from her,1.0
25408,He said to them When you pray say Our Father in heaven May your name be kept holy May your Kingdom come May your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven,1.0
25409,Give us day by day our daily bread,1.0
25410,Forgive us our sins For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us Bring us not into temptation But deliver us from the evil one,1.0
25412,for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to set before him,1.0
25414,I tell you although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as many as he needs,1.0
25415,I tell you keep asking and it will be given you Keep seeking and you will find Keep knocking and it will be opened to you,1.0
25417,Which of you fathers if your son asks for bread will give him a stone Or if he asks for a fish he wont give him a snake instead of a fish will he,1.0
25418,Or if he asks for an egg he wont give him a scorpion will he,1.0
25419,If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him,1.0
25421,But some of them said He casts out demons by Beelzebul the prince of the demons,1.0
25423,But he knowing their thoughts said to them Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation A house divided against itself falls,1.0
25424,If Satan also is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul,1.0
25427,When the strong man fully armed guards his own dwelling his goods are safe,1.0
25429,He that is not with me is against me He who doesnt gather with me scatters,1.0
25430,The unclean spirit when he has gone out of the man passes through dry places seeking rest and finding none he says I will turn back to my house from which I came out,1.0
25431,When he returns he finds it swept and put in order,1.0
25433,It came to pass as he said these things a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice and said to him Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts which nursed you!,1.0
25434,But he said On the contrary blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it,1.0
25435,When the multitudes were gathering together to him he began to say This is an evil generation It seeks after a sign No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet,1.0
25437,The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold one greater than Solomon is here,1.0
25439,No man when he has lit a lamp puts it in a cellar nor under a basket but on a stand that those who enter in may see the light,1.0
25440,The lamp of the body is the eye Therefore when your eye is good your whole body is also full of light but when it is evil your body also is full of darkness,1.0
25441,Therefore see whether the light that is in you isnt darkness,1.0
25442,If therefore your whole body is full of light having no part dark it will be wholly full of light as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light,1.0
25444,When the Pharisee saw it he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner,1.0
25446,You foolish ones didnt he who made the outside make the inside also,1.0
25448,But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb but you bypass justice and the love of God You ought to have done these and not to have left the other undone,1.0
25452,He said Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry and you yourselves wont even lift one finger to help carry those burdens,1.0
25454,So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers For they killed them and you build their tombs,1.0
25457,from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary Yes I tell you it will be required of this generation,1.0
25458,Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge You didnt enter in yourselves and those who were entering in you hindered,1.0
25460,lying in wait for him and seeking to catch him in something he might say that they might accuse him,1.0
25461,Meanwhile when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together so much so that they trampled on each other he began to tell his disciples first of all Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy,1.0
25462,But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed nor hidden that will not be known,1.0
25463,Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops,1.0
25464,I tell you my friends dont be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do,1.0
25466,Arent five sparrows sold for two assaria coins{An assarion was a small copper coin worth about an hours wages for an agricultural laborer} Not one of them is forgotten by God,1.0
25467,But the very hairs of your head are all numbered Therefore dont be afraid You are of more value than many sparrows,1.0
25468,I tell you everyone who confesses me before men him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God,1.0
25469,but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God,1.0
25470,Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven,1.0
25471,When they bring you before the synagogues the rulers and the authorities dont be anxious how or what you will answer or what you will say,1.0
25472,for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say,1.0
25474,But he said to him Man who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you,1.0
25477,He reasoned within himself saying What will I do because I dont have room to store my crops,1.0
25478,He said This is what I will do I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones and there I will store all my grain and my goods,1.0
25479,I will tell my soul Soul you have many goods laid up for many years Take your ease eat drink be merry,1.0
25481,So is he who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God,1.0
25482,He said to his disciples Therefore I tell you dont be anxious for your life what you will eat nor yet for your body what you will wear,1.0
25483,Life is more than food and the body is more than clothing,1.0
25484,Consider the ravens they dont sow they dont reap they have no warehouse or barn and God feeds them How much more valuable are you than birds!,1.0
25485,Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height,1.0
25486,If then you arent able to do even the least things why are you anxious about the rest,1.0
25487,Consider the lilies how they grow They dont toil neither do they spin yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these,1.0
25490,For the nations of the world seek after all of these things but your Father knows that you need these things,1.0
25491,But seek Gods Kingdom and all these things will be added to you,1.0
25492,Dont be afraid little flock for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom,1.0
25494,For where your treasure is there will your heart be also,1.0
25495,Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning,1.0
25496,Be like men watching for their lord when he returns from the marriage feast that when he comes and knocks they may immediately open to him,1.0
25497,Blessed are those servants whom the lord will find watching when he comes Most assuredly I tell you that he will dress himself and make them recline and will come and serve them,1.0
25499,But know this that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into,1.0
25500,Therefore be ready also for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you dont expect him,1.0
25503,Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes,1.0
25504,Truly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has,1.0
25505,But if that servant says in his heart My lord delays his coming and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants and to eat and drink and to be drunken,1.0
25507,That servant who knew his lords will and didnt prepare nor do what he wanted will be beaten with many stripes,1.0
25508,but he who didnt know and did things worthy of stripes will be beaten with few stripes To whoever much is given of him will much be required and to whom much was entrusted of him more will be asked,1.0
25509,I came to throw fire on the earth I wish it were already kindled,1.0
25510,But I have a baptism to be baptized with and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!,1.0
25511,Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth I tell you no but rather division,1.0
25512,For from now on there will be five in one house divided three against two and two against three,1.0
25513,They will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against her mother motherinlaw against her daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw,1.0
25516,You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky but how is it that you dont interpret this time,1.0
25517,Why dont you judge for yourselves what is right,1.0
25518,For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate try diligently on the way to be released from him lest perhaps he drag you to the judge and the judge deliver you to the officer and the officer throw you into prison,1.0
25520,Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices,1.0
25522,I tell you no but unless you repent you will all perish in the same way,1.0
25523,Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem,1.0
25524,I tell you no but unless you repent you will all perish in the same way,1.0
25525,He spoke this parable A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit on it and found none,1.0
25526,He said to the vine dresser Behold these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and found none Cut it down Why does it waste the soil,1.0
25528,If it bears fruit fine but if not after that you can cut it down,1.0
25530,Behold there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and she was bent over and could in no way straighten herself up,1.0
25531,When Jesus saw her he called her and said to her Woman you are freed from your infirmity,1.0
25532,He laid his hands on her and immediately she stood up straight and glorified God,1.0
25533,The ruler of the synagogue being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath said to the multitude There are six days in which men ought to work Therefore come on those days and be healed and not on the Sabbath day!,1.0
25535,Ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan had bound eighteen long years be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day,1.0
25536,As he said these things all his adversaries were disappointed and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him,1.0
25538,It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his own garden It grew and became a large tree and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches,1.0
25540,It is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures{literally three sata 3 sata is about 39 litres or a bit more than a bushel} of flour until it was all leavened,1.0
25542,One said to him Lord are they few who are saved He said to them,1.0
25543,Strive to enter in by the narrow door for many I tell you will seek to enter in and will not be able,1.0
25544,When once the master of the house has risen up and has shut the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door saying Lord Lord open to us! then he will answer and tell you I dont know you or where you come from,1.0
25546,He will say I tell you I dont know where you come from Depart from me all you workers of iniquity,1.0
25548,They will come from the east west north and south and will sit down in the Kingdom of God,1.0
25549,Behold there are some who are last who will be first and there are some who are first who will be last,1.0
25552,Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day for it cant be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem,1.0
25553,Jerusalem Jerusalem that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings and you refused!,1.0
25555,It happened when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread that they were watching him,1.0
25556,Behold a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him,1.0
25557,Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees saying Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath,1.0
25559,He answered them Which of you if your son{TR reads donkey instead of son} or an ox fell into a well wouldnt immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day,1.0
25560,They couldnt answer him regarding these things,1.0
25561,He spoke a parable to those who were invited when he noticed how they chose the best seats and said to them,1.0
25562,When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast dont sit in the best seat since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,1.0
25563,and he who invited both of you would come and tell you Make room for this person Then you would begin with shame to take the lowest place,1.0
25564,But when you are invited go and sit in the lowest place so that when he who invited you comes he may tell you Friend move up higher Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you,1.0
25565,For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted,1.0
25566,He also said to the one who had invited him When you make a dinner or a supper dont call your friends nor your brothers nor your kinsmen nor rich neighbors or perhaps they might also return the favor and pay you back,1.0
25567,But when you make a feast ask the poor the maimed the lame or the blind,1.0
25568,and you will be blessed because they dont have the resources to repay you For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous,1.0
25569,When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things he said to him Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!,1.0
25571,He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited Come for everything is ready now,1.0
25574,Another said I have married a wife and therefore I cant come,1.0
25578,For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper,1.0
25581,Whoever doesnt bear his own cross and come after me cant be my disciple,1.0
25582,For which of you desiring to build a tower doesnt first sit down and count the cost to see if he has enough to complete it,1.0
25583,Or perhaps when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish everyone who sees begins to mock him,1.0
25584,saying This man began to build and wasnt able to finish,1.0
25585,Or what king as he goes to encounter another king in war will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand,1.0
25586,Or else while the other is yet a great way off he sends an envoy and asks for conditions of peace,1.0
25587,So therefore whoever of you who doesnt renounce all that he has he cant be my disciple,1.0
25590,Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him,1.0
25591,The Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying This man welcomes sinners and eats with them,1.0
25593,Which of you men if you had one hundred sheep and lost one of them wouldnt leave the ninetynine in the wilderness and go after the one that was lost until he found it,1.0
25594,When he has found it he carries it on his shoulders rejoicing,1.0
25595,When he comes home he calls together his friends and his neighbors saying to them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost!,1.0
25596,I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninetynine righteous people who need no repentance,1.0
25597,Or what woman if she had ten drachma{A drachma coin was worth about 2 days wages for an agricultural laborer} coins if she lost one drachma coin wouldnt light a lamp sweep the house and seek diligently until she found it,1.0
25598,When she has found it she calls together her friends and neighbors saying Rejoice with me for I have found the drachma which I had lost,1.0
25599,Even so I tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting,1.0
25600,He said A certain man had two sons,1.0
25601,The younger of them said to his father Father give me my share of your property He divided his livelihood between them,1.0
25602,Not many days after the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country There he wasted his property with riotous living,1.0
25603,When he had spent all of it there arose a severe famine in that country and he began to be in need,1.0
25604,He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs,1.0
25606,But when he came to himself he said How many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare and Im dying with hunger!,1.0
25608,I am no more worthy to be called your son Make me as one of your hired servants,1.0
25610,The son said to him Father I have sinned against heaven and in your sight I am no longer worthy to be called your son,1.0
25611,But the father said to his servants Bring out the best robe and put it on him Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet,1.0
25612,Bring the fattened calf kill it and let us eat and celebrate,1.0
25615,He called one of the servants to him and asked what was going on,1.0
25616,He said to him Your brother has come and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and healthy,1.0
25620,He said to him Son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours,1.0
25621,But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad for this your brother was dead and is alive again He was lost and is found,1.0
25622,He also said to his disciples There was a certain rich man who had a manager An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions,1.0
25626,Calling each one of his lords debtors to him he said to the first How much do you owe to my lord,1.0
25628,Then said he to another How much do you owe He said A hundred cors{ 100 cors  about 3910 litres or 600 bushels } of wheat He said to him Take your bill and write eighty,1.0
25629,His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their own generation wiser than the children of the light,1.0
25630,I tell you make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon so that when you fail they may receive you into the eternal tents,1.0
25631,He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much,1.0
25632,If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches,1.0
25633,If you have not been faithful in that which is anothers who will give you that which is your own,1.0
25635,The Pharisees who were lovers of money also heard all these things and they scoffed at him,1.0
25636,He said to them You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men but God knows your hearts For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God,1.0
25638,But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall,1.0
25639,Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery,1.0
25640,Now there was a certain rich man and he was clothed in purple and fine linen living in luxury every day,1.0
25641,A certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate full of sores,1.0
25642,and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich mans table Yes even the dogs came and licked his sores,1.0
25643,It happened that the beggar died and that he was carried away by the angels to Abrahams bosom The rich man also died and was buried,1.0
25644,In Hades he lifted up his eyes being in torment and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his bosom,1.0
25645,He cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame,1.0
25646,But Abraham said Son remember that you in your lifetime received your good things and Lazarus in like manner bad things But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish,1.0
25647,Besides all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed that those who want to pass from here to you are not able and that none may cross over from there to us,1.0
25648,He said I ask you therefore father that you would send him to my fathers house,1.0
25650,But Abraham said to him They have Moses and the prophets Let them listen to them,1.0
25655,Be careful If your brother sins against you rebuke him If he repents forgive him,1.0
25656,If he sins against you seven times in the day and seven times returns saying I repent you shall forgive him,1.0
25657,The apostles said to the Lord Increase our faith,1.0
25658,The Lord said If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed you would tell this sycamore tree Be uprooted and be planted in the sea and it would obey you,1.0
25659,But who is there among you having a servant plowing or keeping sheep that will say when he comes in from the field Come immediately and sit down at the table,1.0
25660,and will not rather tell him Prepare my supper clothe yourself properly and serve me while I eat and drink Afterward you shall eat and drink,1.0
25661,Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded I think not,1.0
25662,Even so you also when you have done all the things that are commanded you say We are unworthy servants We have done our duty,1.0
25663,It happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee,1.0
25664,As he entered into a certain village ten men who were lepers met him who stood at a distance,1.0
25665,They lifted up their voices saying Jesus Master have mercy on us!,1.0
25666,When he saw them he said to them Go and show yourselves to the priests It happened that as they went they were cleansed,1.0
25667,One of them when he saw that he was healed turned back glorifying God with a loud voice,1.0
25670,Were there none found who returned to give glory to God except this stranger,1.0
25671,Then he said to him Get up and go your way Your faith has healed you,1.0
25672,Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come he answered them The Kingdom of God doesnt come with observation,1.0
25673,neither will they say Look here! or Look there! for behold the Kingdom of God is within you,1.0
25676,for as the lightning when it flashes out of the one part under the sky shines to the other part under the sky so will the Son of Man be in his day,1.0
25677,But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation,1.0
25678,As it happened in the days of Noah even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man,1.0
25679,They ate they drank they married they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all,1.0
25680,Likewise even as it happened in the days of Lot they ate they drank they bought they sold they planted they built,1.0
25681,but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and sulfur from the sky and destroyed them all,1.0
25682,It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed,1.0
25683,In that day he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house let him not go down to take them away Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back,1.0
25685,Whoever seeks to save his life loses it but whoever loses his life preserves it,1.0
25686,I tell you in that night there will be two people in one bed The one will be taken and the other will be left,1.0
25687,There will be two grinding grain together One will be taken and the other will be left,1.0
25688,{Some Greek manuscripts add Two will be in the field the one taken and the other left},1.0
25690,He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray and not give up,1.0
25691,saying There was a judge in a certain city who didnt fear God and didnt respect man,1.0
25693,He wouldnt for a while but afterward he said to himself Though I neither fear God nor respect man,1.0
25694,yet because this widow bothers me I will defend her or else she will wear me out by her continual coming,1.0
25695,The Lord said Listen to what the unrighteous judge says,1.0
25697,I tell you that he will avenge them quickly Nevertheless when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth,1.0
25698,He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness and who despised all others,1.0
25699,Two men went up into the temple to pray one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector,1.0
25700,The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this God I thank you that I am not like the rest of men extortioners unrighteous adulterers or even like this tax collector,1.0
25701,I fast twice a week I give tithes of all that I get,1.0
25704,They were also bringing their babies to him that he might touch them But when the disciples saw it they rebuked them,1.0
25705,Jesus summoned them saying Allow the little children to come to me and dont hinder them for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these,1.0
25709,You know the commandments Dont commit adultery Dont murder Dont steal Dont give false testimony Honor your father and your mother,1.0
25710,He said I have observed all these things from my youth up,1.0
25712,But when he heard these things he became very sad for he was very rich,1.0
25714,For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God,1.0
25715,Those who heard it said Then who can be saved,1.0
25716,But he said The things which are impossible with men are possible with God,1.0
25719,who will not receive many times more in this time and in the world to come eternal life,1.0
25721,For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles will be mocked treated shamefully and spit on,1.0
25724,It happened as he came near Jericho a certain blind man sat by the road begging,1.0
25726,They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by,1.0
25727,He cried out Jesus you son of David have mercy on me!,1.0
25728,Those who led the way rebuked him that he should be quiet but he cried out all the more You son of David have mercy on me!,1.0
25732,Immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying God All the people when they saw it praised God,1.0
25734,There was a man named Zacchaeus He was a chief tax collector and he was rich,1.0
25738,He hurried came down and received him joyfully,1.0
25740,Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord Behold Lord half of my goods I give to the poor If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone I restore four times as much,1.0
25742,For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost,1.0
25743,As they heard these things he went on and told a parable because he was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately,1.0
25744,He said therefore A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return,1.0
25746,But his citizens hated him and sent an envoy after him saying We dont want this man to reign over us,1.0
25747,It happened when he had come back again having received the kingdom that he commanded these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him that he might know what they had gained by conducting business,1.0
25748,The first came before him saying Lord your mina has made ten more minas,1.0
25750,The second came saying Your mina Lord has made five minas,1.0
25751,So he said to him And you are to be over five cities,1.0
25753,for I feared you because you are an exacting man You take up that which you didnt lay down and reap that which you didnt sow,1.0
25754,He said to him Out of your own mouth will I judge you you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man taking up that which I didnt lay down and reaping that which I didnt sow,1.0
25756,He said to those who stood by Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas,1.0
25757,They said to him Lord he has ten minas!,1.0
25758,For I tell you that to everyone who has will more be given but from him who doesnt have even that which he has will be taken away from him,1.0
25760,Having said these things he went on ahead going up to Jerusalem,1.0
25762,saying Go your way into the village on the other side in which as you enter you will find a colt tied whereon no man ever yet sat Untie it and bring it,1.0
25765,As they were untying the colt the owners of it said to them Why are you untying the colt,1.0
25766,They said The Lord needs it,1.0
25768,As he went they spread their cloaks in the way,1.0
25770,saying Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!,1.0
25771,Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him Teacher rebuke your disciples!,1.0
25772,He answered them I tell you that if these were silent the stones would cry out,1.0
25773,When he drew near he saw the city and wept over it,1.0
25774,saying If you even you had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes,1.0
25775,For the days will come on you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you surround you hem you in on every side,1.0
25776,and will dash you and your children within you to the ground They will not leave in you one stone on another because you didnt know the time of your visitation,1.0
25778,saying to them It is written My house is a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers!,1.0
25779,He was teaching daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him,1.0
25780,They couldnt find what they might do for all the people hung on to every word that he said,1.0
25781,It happened on one of those days as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Gospel that the {TR adds chief}priests and scribes came to him with the elders,1.0
25782,They asked him Tell us by what authority do you do these things Or who is giving you this authority,1.0
25783,He answered them I also will ask you one question Tell me,1.0
25785,They reasoned with themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say Why didnt you believe him,1.0
25786,But if we say From men all the people will stone us for they are persuaded that John was a prophet,1.0
25788,Jesus said to them Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things,1.0
25790,At the proper season he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty,1.0
25792,He sent yet a third and they also wounded him and threw him out,1.0
25793,The lord of the vineyard said What shall I do I will send my beloved son It may be that seeing him they will respect him,1.0
25794,But when the farmers saw him they reasoned among themselves saying This is the heir Come lets kill him that the inheritance may be ours,1.0
25795,They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them,1.0
25796,He will come and destroy these farmers and will give the vineyard to others When they heard it they said May it never be!,1.0
25798,Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces But it will crush whomever it falls on to dust,1.0
25799,The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him that very hour but they feared the peoplefor they knew He had spoken this parable against them,1.0
25800,They watched him and sent out spies who pretended to be righteous that they might trap him in something he said so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor,1.0
25801,They asked him Teacher we know that you say and teach what is right and arent partial to anyone but truly teach the way of God,1.0
25802,Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not,1.0
25803,But he perceived their craftiness and said to them Why do you test me,1.0
25804,Show me a denarius Whose image and inscription are on it They answered Caesars,1.0
25808,They asked him Teacher Moses wrote to us that if a mans brother dies having a wife and he is childless his brother should take the wife and raise up children for his brother,1.0
25809,There were therefore seven brothers The first took a wife and died childless,1.0
25811,The third took her and likewise the seven all left no children and died,1.0
25812,Afterward the woman also died,1.0
25813,Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be For the seven had her as a wife,1.0
25814,Jesus said to them The children of this age marry and are given in marriage,1.0
25816,For they cant die any more for they are like the angels and are children of God being children of the resurrection,1.0
25817,But that the dead are raised even Moses showed at the bush when he called the Lord The God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,1.0
25818,Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living for all are alive to him,1.0
25819,Some of the scribes answered Teacher you speak well,1.0
25822,David himself says in the book of Psalms The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand,1.0
25824,David therefore calls him Lord so how is he his son,1.0
25825,In the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,1.0
25827,who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers these will receive greater condemnation,1.0
25828,He looked up and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury,1.0
25829,He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins{literally two lepta 2 lepta was about 1 of a days wages for an agricultural laborer},1.0
25830,He said Truly I tell you this poor widow put in more than all of them,1.0
25831,for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on,1.0
25832,As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts he said,1.0
25834,They asked him Teacher so when will these things be What is the sign that these things are about to happen,1.0
25835,He said Watch out that you dont get led astray for many will come in my name saying I AM and The time is at hand Therefore dont follow them,1.0
25837,Then he said to them Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,1.0
25838,There will be great earthquakes famines and plagues in various places There will be terrors and great signs from heaven,1.0
25839,But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you delivering you up to synagogues and prisons bringing you before kings and governors for my names sake,1.0
25840,It will turn out as a testimony for you,1.0
25842,for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict,1.0
25844,You will be hated by all men for my names sake,1.0
25847,But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation is at hand,1.0
25850,Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath to this people,1.0
25853,men fainting for fear and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world for the powers of the heavens will be shaken,1.0
25854,Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory,1.0
25856,He told them a parable See the fig tree and all the trees,1.0
25858,Even so you also when you see these things happening know that the Kingdom of God is near,1.0
25859,Most assuredly I tell you this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished,1.0
25860,Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will by no means pass away,1.0
25861,So be careful or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing drunkenness and cares of this life and that day will come on you suddenly,1.0
25862,For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth,1.0
25865,All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him,1.0
25866,Now the feast of unleavened bread which is called the Passover drew near,1.0
25867,The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death for they feared the people,1.0
25871,He consented and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude,1.0
25872,The day of unleavened bread came on which the Passover must be sacrificed,1.0
25873,He sent Peter and John saying Go and prepare the Passover for us that we may eat,1.0
25875,He said to them Behold when you have entered into the city a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you Follow him into the house which he enters,1.0
25876,Tell the master of the house The Teacher says to you Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples,1.0
25879,When the hour had come he sat down with the twelve apostles,1.0
25880,He said to them I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,1.0
25882,He received a cup and when he had given thanks he said Take this and share it among yourselves,1.0
25883,for I tell you I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes,1.0
25884,He took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave to them saying This is my body which is given for you Do this in memory of me,1.0
25885,Likewise he took the cup after supper saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you,1.0
25888,They began to question among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing,1.0
25889,There arose also a contention among them which of them was considered to be greatest,1.0
25890,He said to them The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them and those who have authority over them are called benefactors,1.0
25892,For who is greater one who sits at the table or one who serves Isnt it he who sits at the table But I am in the midst of you as one who serves,1.0
25893,But you are those who have continued with me in my trials,1.0
25895,that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom You will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel,1.0
25896,The Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan asked to have you that he might sift you as wheat,1.0
25898,He said to him Lord I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!,1.0
25901,Then he said to them But now whoever has a purse let him take it and likewise a wallet Whoever has none let him sell his cloak and buy a sword,1.0
25904,He came out and went as his custom was to the Mount of Olives His disciples also followed him,1.0
25905,When he was at the place he said to them Pray that you dont enter into temptation,1.0
25907,saying Father if you are willing remove this cup from me Nevertheless not my will but yours be done,1.0
25908,An angel from heaven appeared to him strengthening him,1.0
25911,and said to them Why do you sleep Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation,1.0
25913,But Jesus said to him Judas do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss,1.0
25916,But Jesus answered Let me at least do thisand he touched his ear and healed him,1.0
25917,Jesus said to the chief priests captains of the temple and elders who had come against him Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs,1.0
25918,When I was with you in the temple daily you didnt stretch out your hands against me But this is your hour and the power of darkness,1.0
25921,A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light and looking intently at him said This man also was with him,1.0
25922,He denied Jesus saying Woman I dont know him,1.0
25923,After a little while someone else saw him and said You also are one of them! But Peter answered Man I am not!,1.0
25924,After about one hour passed another confidently affirmed saying Truly this man also was with him for he is a Galilean!,1.0
25926,The Lord turned and looked at Peter Then Peter remembered the Lords word how he said to him Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times,1.0
25927,He went out and wept bitterly,1.0
25928,The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him,1.0
25930,They spoke many other things against him insulting him,1.0
25931,As soon as it was day the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together both chief priests and scribes and they led him away into their council saying,1.0
25932,If you are the Christ tell us But he said to them If I tell you you wont believe,1.0
25933,and if I ask you will in no way answer me or let me go,1.0
25934,From now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God,1.0
25938,They began to accuse him saying We found this man perverting the nation forbidding paying taxes to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king,1.0
25939,Pilate asked him Are you the King of the Jews He answered him So you say,1.0
25941,But they insisted saying He stirs up the people teaching throughout all Judea beginning from Galilee even to this place,1.0
25942,But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned he asked if the man was a Galilean,1.0
25943,When he found out that he was in Herods jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who was also in Jerusalem during those days,1.0
25946,The chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him,1.0
25947,Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him Dressing him in luxurious clothing they sent him back to Pilate,1.0
25948,Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day for before that they were enemies with each other,1.0
25951,Neither has Herod for I sent you to him and see nothing worthy of death has been done by him,1.0
25952,I will therefore chastise him and release him,1.0
25957,but they shouted saying Crucify! Crucify him!,1.0
25958,He said to them the third time Why What evil has this man done I have found no capital crime in him I will therefore chastise him and release him,1.0
25961,He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder for whom they asked but he delivered Jesus up to their will,1.0
25963,A great multitude of the people followed him including women who also mourned and lamented him,1.0
25964,But Jesus turning to them said Daughters of Jerusalem dont weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children,1.0
25966,Then they will begin to tell the mountains Fall on us! and tell the hills Cover us,1.0
25967,For if they do these things in the green tree what will be done in the dry,1.0
25969,When they came to the place that is called The Skull they crucified him there with the criminals one on the right and the other on the left,1.0
25970,Jesus said Father forgive them for they dont know what they are doing Dividing his garments among them they cast lots,1.0
25971,The people stood watching The rulers with them also scoffed at him saying He saved others Let him save himself if this is the Christ of God his chosen one!,1.0
25973,and saying If you are the King of the Jews save yourself!,1.0
25974,An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek Latin and Hebrew THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS,1.0
25975,One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him saying If you are the Christ save yourself and us!,1.0
25976,But the other answered and rebuking him said Dont you even fear God seeing you are under the same condemnation,1.0
25977,And we indeed justly for we receive the due reward for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong,1.0
25979,Jesus said to him Assuredly I tell you today you will be with me in Paradise,1.0
25981,The sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was torn in two,1.0
25987,he had not consented to their counsel and deed from Arimathaea a city of the Jews who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God,1.0
25988,this man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus body,1.0
25989,He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone where no one had ever been laid,1.0
25990,It was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath was drawing near,1.0
25991,The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after and saw the tomb and how his body was laid,1.0
25993,But on the first day of the week at early dawn they and some others came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared,1.0
25994,They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,1.0
25995,They entered in and didnt find the Lord Jesus body,1.0
25996,It happened while they were greatly perplexed about this behold two men stood by them in dazzling clothing,1.0
25998,He isnt here but is risen Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,1.0
26000,They remembered his words,1.0
26002,Now they were Mary Magdalene Joanna and Mary the mother of James The other women with them told these things to the apostles,1.0
26003,These words seemed to them to be nonsense and they didnt believe them,1.0
26004,But Peter got up and ran to the tomb Stooping and looking in he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves and he departed to his home wondering what had happened,1.0
26005,Behold two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus which was sixty stadia{60 stadia  about 11 kilometers or about 7 miles} from Jerusalem,1.0
26006,They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened,1.0
26007,It happened while they talked and questioned together that Jesus himself came near and went with them,1.0
26010,One of them named Cleopas answered him Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesnt know the things which have happened there in these days,1.0
26011,He said to them What things They said to him The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,1.0
26013,But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel Yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things happened,1.0
26015,and when they didnt find his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive,1.0
26017,He said to them Foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!,1.0
26018,Didnt the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory,1.0
26022,It happened that when he had sat down at the table with them he took the bread and gave thanks Breaking it he gave to them,1.0
26024,They said one to another Werent our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us along the way and while he opened the Scriptures to us,1.0
26026,saying The Lord is risen indeed and has appeared to Simon!,1.0
26027,They related the things that happened along the way and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread,1.0
26030,He said to them Why are you troubled Why do doubts arise in your hearts,1.0
26032,When he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet,1.0
26035,He took them and ate in front of them,1.0
26037,Then he opened their minds that they might understand the Scriptures,1.0
26038,He said to them Thus it is written and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,1.0
26041,Behold I send forth the promise of my Father on you But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high,1.0
26042,He led them out as far as Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them,1.0
26043,It happened while he blessed them that he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven,1.0
26045,and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God Amen,1.0
26046,In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God,1.0
26050,The light shines in the darkness and the darkness hasnt overcome{The word translated overcome katelaben can also be translated comprehended It refers to getting a grip on an enemy to defeat him} it,1.0
26051,There came a man sent from God whose name was John,1.0
26052,The same came as a witness that he might testify about the light that all might believe through him,1.0
26053,He was not the light but was sent that he might testify about the light,1.0
26054,The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world,1.0
26058,who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God,1.0
26059,The Word became flesh and lived among us We saw his glory such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father full of grace and truth,1.0
26060,John testified about him He cried out saying This was he of whom I said He who comes after me has surpassed me for he was before me,1.0
26061,From his fullness we all received grace upon grace,1.0
26064,This is Johns testimony when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him Who are you,1.0
26067,They said therefore to him Who are you Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us What do you say about yourself,1.0
26069,The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees,1.0
26070,They asked him Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet,1.0
26072,He is the one who comes after me who is preferred before me whose sandal strap Im not worthy to loosen,1.0
26074,The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!,1.0
26076,I didnt know him but for this reason I came baptizing in water that he would be revealed to Israel,1.0
26077,John testified saying I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven and it remained on him,1.0
26078,I didnt recognize him but he who sent me to baptize in water he said to me On whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit,1.0
26080,Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,1.0
26082,The two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus,1.0
26083,Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them What are you looking for They said to him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Teacher where are you staying,1.0
26084,He said to them Come and see They came and saw where he was staying and they stayed with him that day It was about the tenth hour{400 PM},1.0
26085,One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew Simon Peters brother,1.0
26086,He first found his own brother Simon and said to him We have found the Messiah! which is being interpreted Christ{Messiah Hebrew and Christ Greek both mean Anointed One},1.0
26088,On the next day he was determined to go out into Galilee and he found Philip Jesus said to him Follow me,1.0
26089,Now Philip was from Bethsaida of the city of Andrew and Peter,1.0
26091,Nathanael said to him Can any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip said to him Come and see,1.0
26092,Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said about him Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no deceit!,1.0
26094,Nathanael answered him Rabbi you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!,1.0
26096,He said to him Most assuredly I tell you hereafter you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man,1.0
26099,When the wine ran out Jesus mother said to him They have no wine,1.0
26100,Jesus said to her Woman what does that have to do with you and me My hour has not yet come,1.0
26101,His mother said to the servants Whatever he says to you do it,1.0
26102,Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews manner of purifying containing two or three metretes{2 to 3 metretes is about 20 to 30 U S Gallons 16 to 25 imperial gallons or 75 to 115 litres} apiece,1.0
26104,He said to them Now draw some out and take it to the ruler of the feast So they took it,1.0
26105,When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine and didnt know where it came from but the servants who had drawn the water knew the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,1.0
26106,and said to him Everyone serves the good wine first and when the guests have drunk freely then that which is worse You have kept the good wine until now!,1.0
26109,The Passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,1.0
26110,He found in the temple those who sold oxen sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting,1.0
26111,He made a whip of cords and threw all out of the temple both the sheep and the oxen and he poured out the changers money and overthrew their tables,1.0
26113,His disciples remembered that it was written Zeal for your house will eat me up,1.0
26115,Jesus answered them Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,1.0
26116,The Jews therefore said Fortysix years was this temple in building and will you raise it up in three days,1.0
26117,But he spoke of the temple of his body,1.0
26118,When therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he said this and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said,1.0
26119,Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed in his name observing his signs which he did,1.0
26121,and because he didnt need for anyone to testify concerning man for he himself knew what was in man,1.0
26122,Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews,1.0
26125,Nicodemus said to him How can a man be born when he is old Can he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born,1.0
26127,That which is born of the flesh is flesh That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,1.0
26128,Dont marvel that I said to you You must be born anew,1.0
26129,The wind{The same Greek word pneuma means wind breath and spirit} blows where it wants to and you hear its sound but dont know where it comes from and where it is going So is everyone who is born of the Spirit,1.0
26131,Jesus answered him Are you the teacher of Israel and dont understand these things,1.0
26132,Most assuredly I tell you we speak that which we know and testify of that which we have seen and you dont receive our witness,1.0
26133,If I told you earthly things and you dont believe how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things,1.0
26134,No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended out of heaven the Son of Man who is in heaven,1.0
26135,As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,1.0
26136,that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life,1.0
26139,He who believes in him is not judged He who doesnt believe has been judged already because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God,1.0
26141,For everyone who does evil hates the light and doesnt come to the light lest his works would be exposed,1.0
26142,But he who does the truth comes to the light that his works may be revealed that they have been done in God,1.0
26143,After these things Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea He stayed there with them and baptized,1.0
26145,For John was not yet thrown into prison,1.0
26146,There arose therefore a questioning on the part of Johns disciples with some Jews about purification,1.0
26147,They came to John and said to him Rabbi he who was with you beyond the Jordan to whom you have testified behold the same baptizes and everyone is coming to him,1.0
26149,You yourselves testify that I said I am not the Christ but I have been sent before him,1.0
26155,For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God for God gives the Spirit without measure,1.0
26158,Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John,1.0
26159,although Jesus himself didnt baptize but his disciples,1.0
26161,He needed to pass through Samaria,1.0
26162,So he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph,1.0
26164,A woman of Samaria came to draw water Jesus said to her Give me a drink,1.0
26165,For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food,1.0
26167,Jesus answered her If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you Give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water,1.0
26168,The woman said to him Sir you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep From where then have you that living water,1.0
26169,Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank of it himself as did his children and his cattle,1.0
26170,Jesus answered her Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,1.0
26171,but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life,1.0
26175,for you have had five husbands and he whom you now have is not your husband This you have said truly,1.0
26179,You worship that which you dont know We worship that which we know for salvation is from the Jews,1.0
26182,The woman said to him I know that Messiah comes he who is called Christ When he has come he will declare to us all things,1.0
26184,At this his disciples came They marveled that he was speaking with a woman yet no one said What are you looking for or Why do you speak with her,1.0
26186,Come see a man who told me everything that I did Can this be the Christ,1.0
26187,They went out of the city and were coming to him,1.0
26189,But he said to them I have food to eat that you dont know about,1.0
26190,The disciples therefore said one to another Has anyone brought him something to eat,1.0
26193,He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to eternal life that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together,1.0
26194,For in this the saying is true One sows and another reaps,1.0
26195,I sent you to reap that for which you havent labored Others have labored and you have entered into their labor,1.0
26197,So when the Samaritans came to him they begged him to stay with them He stayed there two days,1.0
26198,Many more believed because of his word,1.0
26202,So when he came into Galilee the Galileans received him having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast for they also went to the feast,1.0
26203,Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee where he made the water into wine There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum,1.0
26205,Jesus therefore said to him Unless you see signs and wonders you will in no way believe,1.0
26206,The nobleman said to him Sir come down before my child dies,1.0
26207,Jesus said to him Go your way Your son lives The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and he went his way,1.0
26208,As he was now going down his servants met him and reported saying Your child lives!,1.0
26212,After these things there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,1.0
26213,Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate there is a pool which is called in Hebrew Bethesda having five porches,1.0
26217,When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been sick for a long time he asked him Do you want to be made well,1.0
26218,The sick man answered him Sir I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up but while Im coming another steps down before me,1.0
26220,Immediately the man was made well and took up his mat and walked Now it was the Sabbath on that day,1.0
26222,He answered them He who made me well the same said to me Take up your mat and walk,1.0
26223,Then they asked him Who is the man who said to you Take up your mat and walk,1.0
26224,But he who was healed didnt know who it was for Jesus had withdrawn a crowd being in the place,1.0
26227,For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill him because he did these things on the Sabbath,1.0
26233,For the Father judges no one but he has given all judgment to the Son,1.0
26234,that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father He who doesnt honor the Son doesnt honor the Father who sent him,1.0
26235,Most assuredly I tell you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and doesnt come into judgment but has passed out of death into life,1.0
26236,Most assuredly I tell you the hour comes and now is when the dead will hear the Son of Gods voice and those who hear will live,1.0
26240,and will come out those who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment,1.0
26241,I can of myself do nothing As I hear I judge and my judgment is righteous because I dont seek my own will but the will of my Father who sent me,1.0
26242,If I testify about myself my witness is not valid,1.0
26243,It is another who testifies about me I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true,1.0
26244,You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth,1.0
26245,But the testimony which I receive is not from man However I say these things that you may be saved,1.0
26246,He was the burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light,1.0
26248,The Father himself who sent me has testified about me You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form,1.0
26250,You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and these are they which testify about me,1.0
26251,Yet you will not come to me that you may have life,1.0
26253,But I know you that you dont have Gods love in yourselves,1.0
26254,I have come in my Fathers name and you dont receive me If another comes in his own name you will receive him,1.0
26255,How can you believe who receive glory from one another and you dont seek the glory that comes from the only God,1.0
26256,Dont think that I will accuse you to the Father There is one who accuses you even Moses on whom you have set your hope,1.0
26258,But if you dont believe his writings how will you believe my words,1.0
26260,A great multitude followed him because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick,1.0
26261,Jesus went up into the mountain and he sat there with his disciples,1.0
26264,This he said to test him for he himself knew what he would do,1.0
26265,Philip answered him Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them that everyone of them may receive a little,1.0
26269,Jesus took the loaves and having given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to those who were sitting down likewise also of the fish as much as they desired,1.0
26270,When they were filled he said to his disciples Gather up the broken pieces which are left over that nothing be lost,1.0
26272,When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did they said This is truly the prophet who comes into the world,1.0
26273,Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king withdrew again to the mountain by himself,1.0
26277,When therefore they had rowed about twentyfive or thirty stadia{25 to 30 stadia is about 5 to 6 kilometers or about 3 to 4 miles} they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat and they were afraid,1.0
26278,But he said to them I AM Dont be afraid,1.0
26279,They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going,1.0
26280,On the next day the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one in which his disciples had embarked and that Jesus hadnt entered with his disciples into the boat but his disciples had gone away alone,1.0
26282,When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasnt there nor his disciples they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus,1.0
26283,When they found him on the other side of the sea they asked him Rabbi when did you come here,1.0
26286,They said therefore to him What must we do that we may work the works of God,1.0
26287,Jesus answered them This is the work of God that you believe in him whom he has sent,1.0
26288,They said therefore to him What then do you do for a sign that we may see and believe you What work do you do,1.0
26289,Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness As it is written He gave them bread out of heaven{Greek and Hebrew use the same word for heaven the heavens the sky and the air} to eat,1.0
26290,Jesus therefore said to them Most assuredly I tell you it wasnt Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven,1.0
26291,For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world,1.0
26292,They said therefore to him Lord always give us this bread,1.0
26293,Jesus said to them I am the bread of life He who comes to me will not be hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty,1.0
26295,All those who the Father gives me will come to me Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out,1.0
26297,This is the will of my Father who sent me that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing but should raise him up at the last day,1.0
26298,This is the will of the one who sent me that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day,1.0
26299,The Jews therefore murmured concerning him because he said I am the bread which came down out of heaven,1.0
26300,They said Isnt this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know How then does he say I have come down out of heaven,1.0
26302,No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him and I will raise him up in the last day,1.0
26303,It is written in the prophets They will all be taught by God Therefore everyone who hears from the Father and has learned comes to me,1.0
26304,Not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God He has seen the Father,1.0
26305,Most assuredly I tell you he who believes in me has eternal life,1.0
26306,I am the bread of life,1.0
26309,I am the living bread which came down out of heaven If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever Yes the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh,1.0
26311,Jesus therefore said to them Most assuredly I tell you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you dont have life in yourselves,1.0
26313,For my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed,1.0
26315,As the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father so he who feeds on me he will also live because of me,1.0
26316,This is the bread which came down out of heaven not as our fathers ate the manna and died He who eats this bread will live forever,1.0
26317,These things he said in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum,1.0
26319,But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this said to them Does this cause you to stumble,1.0
26320,Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before,1.0
26321,It is the spirit who gives life The flesh profits nothing The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life,1.0
26322,But there are some of you who dont believe For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didnt believe and who it was who would betray him,1.0
26325,Jesus said therefore to the twelve You dont also want to go away do you,1.0
26326,Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom would we go You have the words of eternal life,1.0
26327,We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ the Son of the living God,1.0
26331,Now the feast of the Jews the Feast of Booths was at hand,1.0
26333,For no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly If you do these things reveal yourself to the world,1.0
26334,For even his brothers didnt believe in him,1.0
26335,Jesus therefore said to them My time has not yet come but your time is always ready,1.0
26336,The world cant hate you but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil,1.0
26337,You go up to the feast I am not yet going up to this feast because my time is not yet fulfilled,1.0
26338,Having said these things to them he stayed in Galilee,1.0
26342,Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews,1.0
26344,The Jews therefore marveled saying How does this man know letters having never been educated,1.0
26345,Jesus therefore answered them My teaching is not mine but his who sent me,1.0
26346,If anyone desires to do his will he will know about the teaching whether it is from God or if I am speaking from myself,1.0
26347,He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him,1.0
26348,Didnt Moses give you the law and yet none of you keeps the law Why do you seek to kill me,1.0
26349,The multitude answered You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you,1.0
26350,Jesus answered them I did one work and you all marvel because of it,1.0
26351,Moses has given you circumcision not that it is of Moses but of the fathers and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy,1.0
26353,Dont judge according to appearance but judge righteous judgment,1.0
26355,Behold he speaks openly and they say nothing to him Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ,1.0
26357,Jesus therefore cried out in the temple teaching and saying You both know me and know where I am from I have not come of myself but he who sent me is true whom you dont know,1.0
26359,They sought therefore to take him but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come,1.0
26360,But of the multitude many believed in him They said When the Christ comes he wont do more signs than those which this man has done will he,1.0
26361,The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him,1.0
26362,Then Jesus said I will be with you a little while longer then I go to him who sent me,1.0
26365,What is this word that he said You will seek me and wont find me and where I am you cant come,1.0
26366,Now on the last and greatest day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out If anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink!,1.0
26370,Others said This is the Christ But some said What does the Christ come out of Galilee,1.0
26371,Hasnt the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David and from Bethlehem the village where David was,1.0
26373,Some of them would have arrested him but no one laid hands on him,1.0
26374,The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees and they said to them Why didnt you bring him,1.0
26375,The officers answered No man ever spoke like this man!,1.0
26376,The Pharisees therefore answered them You arent also led astray are you,1.0
26378,But this multitude that doesnt know the law is accursed,1.0
26379,Nicodemus he who came to him by night being one of them said to them,1.0
26380,Does our law judge a man unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does,1.0
26381,They answered him Are you also from Galilee Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee,1.0
26383,but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives,1.0
26384,Now very early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came to him He sat down and taught them,1.0
26386,they told him Teacher we found this woman in adultery in the very act,1.0
26387,Now in our law Moses commanded us to stone such What then do you say about her,1.0
26389,But when they continued asking him he looked up and said to them He who is without sin among you let him throw the first stone at her,1.0
26390,Again he stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground,1.0
26391,They when they heard it being convicted by their conscience went out one by one beginning from the oldest even to the last Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was in the middle,1.0
26392,Jesus standing up saw her and said Woman where are your accusers Did no one condemn you,1.0
26393,She said No one Lord Jesus said Neither do I condemn you Go your way From now on sin no more,1.0
26394,Again therefore Jesus spoke to them saying I am the light of the world He who follows me will not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life,1.0
26397,You judge according to the flesh I judge no one,1.0
26400,I am one who testifies about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me,1.0
26401,They said therefore to him Where is your Father Jesus answered You know neither me nor my Father If you knew me you would know my Father also,1.0
26402,Jesus spoke these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple Yet no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come,1.0
26404,The Jews therefore said Will he kill himself that he says Where I am going you cant come,1.0
26405,He said to them You are from beneath I am from above You are of this world I am not of this world,1.0
26408,I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you However he who sent me is true and the things which I heard from him these I say to the world,1.0
26416,Jesus answered them Most assuredly I tell you everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin,1.0
26417,A bondservant doesnt live in the house forever A son remains forever,1.0
26418,If therefore the Son makes you free you will be free indeed,1.0
26419,I know that you are Abrahams seed yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you,1.0
26425,Why dont you understand my speech Because you cant hear my word,1.0
26427,But because I tell the truth you dont believe me,1.0
26428,Which of you convicts me of sin If I tell the truth why do you not believe me,1.0
26430,Then the Jews answered him Dont we say well that you are a Samaritan and have a demon,1.0
26431,Jesus answered I dont have a demon but I honor my Father and you dishonor me,1.0
26432,But I dont seek my own glory There is one who seeks and judges,1.0
26435,Are you greater than our father Abraham who died The prophets died Who do you make yourself out to be,1.0
26436,Jesus answered If I glorify myself my glory is nothing It is my Father who glorifies me of whom you say that he is our God,1.0
26437,You have not known him but I know him If I said I dont know him I would be like you a liar But I know him and keep his word,1.0
26439,The Jews therefore said to him You are not yet fifty years old and have you seen Abraham,1.0
26443,His disciples asked him Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind,1.0
26444,Jesus answered Neither did this man sin nor his parents but that the works of God might be revealed in him,1.0
26448,and said to him Go wash in the pool of Siloam which means Sent So he went away washed and came back seeing,1.0
26449,The neighbors therefore and those who saw that he was blind before said Isnt this he who sat and begged,1.0
26450,Others were saying It is he Still others were saying He looks like him He said I am he,1.0
26451,They therefore were asking him How were your eyes opened,1.0
26453,Then they asked him Where is he He said I dont know,1.0
26456,Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight He said to them He put mud on my eyes I washed and I see,1.0
26457,Some therefore of the Pharisees said This man is not from God because he doesnt keep the Sabbath Others said How can a man who is a sinner do such signs There was division among them,1.0
26461,His parents answered them We know that this is our son and that he was born blind,1.0
26463,His parents said these things because they feared the Jews for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ he would be put out of the synagogue,1.0
26467,They said to him again What did he do to you How did he open your eyes,1.0
26468,He answered them I told you already and you didnt listen Why do you want to hear it again You dont also want to become his disciples do you,1.0
26469,They insulted him and said You are his disciple but we are disciples of Moses,1.0
26471,The man answered them How amazing! You dont know where he comes from yet he opened my eyes,1.0
26472,We know that God doesnt listen to sinners but if anyone is a worshipper of God and does his will he listens to him,1.0
26473,Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind,1.0
26474,If this man were not from God he could do nothing,1.0
26475,They answered him You were altogether born in sins and do you teach us They threw him out,1.0
26476,Jesus heard that they had thrown him out and finding him he said Do you believe in the Son of God,1.0
26477,He answered Who is he Lord that I may believe in him,1.0
26479,He said Lord I believe! and he worshiped him,1.0
26480,Jesus said I came into this world for judgment that those who dont see may see and that those who see may become blind,1.0
26481,Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said to him Are we also blind,1.0
26482,Jesus said to them If you were blind you would have no sin but now you say We see Therefore your sin remains,1.0
26483,Most assuredly I tell you one who doesnt enter by the door into the sheep fold but climbs up some other way the same is a thief and a robber,1.0
26485,The gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep listen to his voice He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out,1.0
26486,Whenever he brings out his own sheep he goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice,1.0
26489,Jesus therefore said to them again Most assuredly I tell you I am the sheeps door,1.0
26490,All who came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep didnt listen to them,1.0
26491,I am the door If anyone enters in by me he will be saved and will go in and go out and will find pasture,1.0
26493,I am the good shepherd The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep,1.0
26494,He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd who doesnt own the sheep sees the wolf coming leaves the sheep and flees The wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them,1.0
26495,The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand and doesnt care for the sheep,1.0
26497,even as the Father knows me and I know the Father I lay down my life for the sheep,1.0
26499,Therefore the Father loves me because I lay down my life that I may take it again,1.0
26500,No one takes it away from me but I lay it down by myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again I received this commandment from my Father,1.0
26501,Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words,1.0
26502,Many of them said He has a demon and is insane! Why do you listen to him,1.0
26503,Others said These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon It isnt possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind is it,1.0
26504,It was the Feast of the Dedication{The Feast of the Dedication is the Greek name for Chanukkah a celebration of the rededication of the Temple} at Jerusalem,1.0
26506,The Jews therefore came around him and said to him How long will you hold us in suspense If you are the Christ tell us plainly,1.0
26507,Jesus answered them I told you and you dont believe The works that I do in my Fathers name these testify about me,1.0
26508,But you dont believe because you are not of my sheep as I told you,1.0
26509,My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me,1.0
26510,I give eternal life to them They will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand,1.0
26511,My Father who has given them to me is greater than all No one is able to snatch them out of my Fathers hand,1.0
26512,I and the Father are one,1.0
26514,Jesus answered them I have shown you many good works from my Father For which of those works do you stone me,1.0
26515,The Jews answered him We dont stone you for a good work but for blasphemy because you being a man make yourself God,1.0
26517,If he called them gods to whom the word of God came and the Scripture cant be broken,1.0
26518,Do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world You blaspheme because I said I am the Son of God,1.0
26521,They sought again to seize him and he went out of their hand,1.0
26523,Many came to him They said John indeed did no sign but everything that John said about this man is true,1.0
26524,Many believed in him there,1.0
26525,Now a certain man was sick Lazarus from Bethany of the village of Mary and her sister Martha,1.0
26528,But when Jesus heard it he said This sickness is not to death but for the glory of God that Gods Son may be glorified by it,1.0
26529,Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus,1.0
26530,When therefore he heard that he was sick he stayed two days in the place where he was,1.0
26532,The disciples told him Rabbi the Jews were just trying to stone you and are you going there again,1.0
26534,But if a man walks in the night he stumbles because the light isnt in him,1.0
26536,The disciples therefore said Lord if he has fallen asleep he will recover,1.0
26538,So Jesus said to them plainly then Lazarus is dead,1.0
26539,I am glad for your sakes that I was not there so that you may believe Nevertheless lets go to him,1.0
26542,Now Bethany was near Jerusalem about fifteen stadia{15 stadia is about 28 kilometers or 17 miles} away,1.0
26545,Therefore Martha said to Jesus Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldnt have died,1.0
26546,Even now I know that whatever you ask of God God will give you,1.0
26547,Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again,1.0
26553,When she heard this she arose quickly and went to him,1.0
26556,Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying to him Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldnt have died,1.0
26557,When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews weeping who came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled,1.0
26559,Jesus wept,1.0
26565,So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying Jesus lifted up his eyes and said Father I thank you that you listened to me,1.0
26566,I know that you always listen to me but because of the multitude that stands around I said this that they may believe that you sent me,1.0
26569,Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him,1.0
26570,But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done,1.0
26571,The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council and said What are we doing For this man does many signs,1.0
26572,If we leave him alone like this everyone will believe in him and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation,1.0
26573,But a certain one of them Caiaphas being high priest that year said to them You know nothing at all,1.0
26575,Now he didnt say this of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,1.0
26580,Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another as they stood in the temple What do you thinkthat he isnt coming to the feast at all,1.0
26581,Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was he should report it that they might seize him,1.0
26583,So they made him a supper there Martha served but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him,1.0
26585,Then Judas Iscariot Simons son one of his disciples who would betray him said,1.0
26586,Why wasnt this ointment sold for three hundred denarii{300 denarii was about a years wages for an agricultural laborer} and given to the poor,1.0
26587,Now he said this not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and having the money box used to steal what was put into it,1.0
26588,But Jesus said Leave her alone She has kept this for the day of my burial,1.0
26589,For you always have the poor with you but you dont always have me,1.0
26590,A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there and they came not for Jesus sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead,1.0
26591,But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,1.0
26592,because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus,1.0
26593,On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,1.0
26594,they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord the King of Israel!,1.0
26596,Dont be afraid daughter of Zion Behold your King comes sitting on a donkeys colt,1.0
26597,His disciples didnt understand these things at first but when Jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things were written about him and that they had done these things to him,1.0
26598,The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead was testifying about it,1.0
26601,Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast,1.0
26608,Now my soul is troubled What shall I say Father save me from this time But for this cause I came to this time,1.0
26609,Father glorify your name! Then there came a voice out of the sky saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again,1.0
26611,Jesus answered This voice hasnt come for my sake but for your sakes,1.0
26612,Now is the judgment of this world Now the prince of this world will be cast out,1.0
26613,And I if I am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself,1.0
26614,But he said this signifying by what kind of death he should die,1.0
26615,The multitude answered him We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever How do you say The Son of Man must be lifted up Who is this Son of Man,1.0
26616,Jesus therefore said to them Yet a little while the light is with you Walk while you have the light that darkness doesnt overtake you He who walks in the darkness doesnt know where he is going,1.0
26618,But though he had done so many signs before them yet they didnt believe in him,1.0
26619,that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spoke Lord who has believed our report To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed,1.0
26621,He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart Lest they should see with their eyes And perceive with their heart And would turn And I would heal them,1.0
26622,Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke of him,1.0
26623,Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him but because of the Pharisees they didnt confess it so that they wouldnt be put out of the synagogue,1.0
26630,For I spoke not from myself but the Father who sent me he gave me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak,1.0
26631,I know that his commandment is eternal life The things therefore which I speak even as the Father has said to me so I speak,1.0
26633,After supper the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simons son to betray him,1.0
26634,Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he came forth from God and was going to God,1.0
26635,arose from supper and laid aside his outer garments He took a towel and wrapped a towel around his waist,1.0
26637,Then he came to Simon Peter He said to him Lord do you wash my feet,1.0
26638,Jesus answered him You dont know what I am doing now but you will understand later,1.0
26641,Jesus said to him Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed but is completely clean You are clean but not all of you,1.0
26643,So when he had washed their feet put his outer garment back on and sat down again he said to them Do you know what I have done to you,1.0
26644,You call me Teacher and Lord You say so correctly for so I am,1.0
26647,Most assuredly I tell you a servant is not greater than his lord neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him,1.0
26648,If you know these things blessed are you if you do them,1.0
26650,From now on I tell you before it happens that when it happens you may believe that I AM,1.0
26652,When Jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit and testified Most assuredly I tell you that one of you will betray me,1.0
26653,The disciples looked at one another perplexed about whom he spoke,1.0
26655,Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him and said to him Tell us who it is of whom he speaks,1.0
26656,He leaning back as he was on Jesus breast asked him Lord who is it,1.0
26657,Jesus therefore answered It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it So when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot,1.0
26661,Therefore having received that morsel he went out immediately It was night,1.0
26666,By this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another,1.0
26667,Simon Peter said to him Lord where are you going Jesus answered Where I am going you cant follow now but you will follow afterwards,1.0
26669,Jesus answered him Will you lay down your life for me Most assuredly I tell you the rooster wont crow until you have denied me three times,1.0
26670,Dont let your heart be troubled Believe in God Believe also in me,1.0
26671,In my Fathers house are many mansions If it werent so I would have told you I am going to prepare a place for you,1.0
26673,Where I go you know and you know the way,1.0
26674,Thomas says to him Lord we dont know where you are going How can we know the way,1.0
26675,Jesus said to him I am the way the truth and the life No one comes to the Father except through me,1.0
26676,If you had known me you would have known my Father also From now on you know him and have seen him,1.0
26677,Philip said to him Lord show us the Father and that will be enough for us,1.0
26678,Jesus said to him Have I been with you such a long time and do you not know me Philip He who has seen me has seen the Father How do you say Show us the Father,1.0
26679,Dont you believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me The words that I tell you I speak not from myself but the Father who lives in me does his works,1.0
26680,Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me or else believe me for the very works sake,1.0
26681,Most assuredly I tell you he who believes in me the works that I do he will do also and greater works than these will he do because I am going to my Father,1.0
26682,Whatever you will ask in my name that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son,1.0
26683,If you will ask anything in my name I will do it,1.0
26684,If you love me keep my commandments,1.0
26685,I will pray to the Father and he will give you another Counselor{Greek Parakleton Counselor Helper Intercessor Advocate and Comfortor} that he may be with you forever,1.0
26686,the Spirit of truth whom the world cant receive for it doesnt see him neither knows him You know him for he lives with you and will be in you,1.0
26689,In that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you,1.0
26690,One who has my commandments and keeps them that person is one who loves me One who loves me will be loved by my Father and I will love him and will reveal myself to him,1.0
26691,Judas not Iscariot said to him Lord what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us and not to the world,1.0
26692,Jesus answered him If a man loves me he will keep my word My Father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him,1.0
26694,I have said these things to you while still living with you,1.0
26695,But the Counselor the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name he will teach you all things and will remind you of all that I said to you,1.0
26696,Peace I leave with you My peace I give to you not as the world gives give I to you Dont let your heart be troubled neither let it be fearful,1.0
26697,You heard how I told you I go away and I come to you If you loved me you would have rejoiced because I said I am going to my Father for the Father is greater than I,1.0
26698,Now I have told you before it happens so that when it happens you may believe,1.0
26699,I will no more speak much with you for the prince of the world comes and he has nothing in me,1.0
26701,I am the true vine and my Father is the farmer,1.0
26703,You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you,1.0
26704,Remain in me and I in you As the branch cant bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine so neither can you unless you remain in me,1.0
26705,I am the vine You are the branches He who remains in me and I in him the same bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing,1.0
26706,If a man doesnt remain in me he is thrown out as a branch and is withered and they gather them throw them into the fire and they are burned,1.0
26707,If you remain in me and my words remain in you you will ask whatever you desire and it will be done for you,1.0
26708,In this is my Father glorified that you bear much fruit and so you will be my disciples,1.0
26709,Even as the Father has loved me I also have loved you Remain in my love,1.0
26710,If you keep my commandments you will remain in my love even as I have kept my Fathers commandments and remain in his love,1.0
26714,You are my friends if you do whatever I command you,1.0
26715,No longer do I call you servants for the servant doesnt know what his lord does But I have called you friends for everything that I heard from my Father I have made known to you,1.0
26719,If you were of the world the world would love its own But because you are not of the world since I chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you,1.0
26720,Remember the word that I said to you A servant is not greater than his lord If they persecuted me they will also persecute you If they kept my word they will keep yours also,1.0
26721,But all these things will they do to you for my names sake because they dont know him who sent me,1.0
26722,If I had not come and spoken to them they would not have had sin but now they have no excuse for their sin,1.0
26725,But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law They hated me without a cause,1.0
26727,You will also testify because you have been with me from the beginning,1.0
26728,These things have I spoken to you so that you wouldnt be caused to stumble,1.0
26729,They will put you out of the synagogues Yes the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God,1.0
26732,But now I am going to him who sent me and none of you asks me Where are you going,1.0
26733,But because I have told you these things sorrow has filled your heart,1.0
26735,When he has come he will convict the world about sin about righteousness and about judgment,1.0
26736,about sin because they dont believe in me,1.0
26738,about judgment because the prince of this world has been judged,1.0
26741,He will glorify me for he will take from what is mine and will declare it to you,1.0
26742,All things whatever the Father has are mine therefore I said that he takes{TR reads will take instead of takes} of mine and will declare it to you,1.0
26743,A little while and you will not see me Again a little while and you will see me,1.0
26744,Some of his disciples therefore said to one another What is this that he says to us A little while and you wont see me and again a little while and you will see me and Because I go to the Father,1.0
26746,Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him and he said to them Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this that I said A little while and you wont see me and again a little while and you will see me,1.0
26747,Most assuredly I tell you that you will weep and lament but the world will rejoice You will be sorrowful but your sorrow will be turned into joy,1.0
26748,A woman when she gives birth has sorrow because her time has come But when she has delivered the child she doesnt remember the anguish any more for the joy that a human being is born into the world,1.0
26749,Therefore you now have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice and no one will take your joy away from you,1.0
26752,I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father,1.0
26753,In that day you will ask in my name and I dont say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,1.0
26755,I came out from the Father and have come into the world Again I leave the world and go to the Father,1.0
26757,Now we know that you know all things and dont need for anyone to question you By this we believe that you came forth from God,1.0
26758,Jesus answered them Do you now believe,1.0
26761,Jesus said these things and lifting up his eyes to heaven he said Father the time has come Glorify your Son that your Son may also glorify you,1.0
26762,even as you gave him authority over all flesh he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him,1.0
26763,This is eternal life that they should know you the only true God and him whom you sent Jesus Christ,1.0
26769,I pray for them I dont pray for the world but for those whom you have given me for they are yours,1.0
26770,All things that are mine are yours and yours are mine and I am glorified in them,1.0
26772,While I was with them in the world I kept them in your name Those whom you have given me I have kept None of them is lost except the son of destruction that the Scripture might be fulfilled,1.0
26774,I have given them your word The world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world,1.0
26776,They are not of the world even as I am not of the world,1.0
26777,Sanctify them in your truth Your word is truth,1.0
26781,that they may all be one even as you Father are in me and I in you that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that you sent me,1.0
26784,Father I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am that they may see my glory which you have given me for you loved me before the foundation of the world,1.0
26785,Righteous Father the world hasnt known you but I knew you and these knew that you sent me,1.0
26787,When Jesus had spoken these words he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron where was a garden into which he and his disciples entered,1.0
26788,Now Judas who betrayed him also knew the place for Jesus often resorted there with his disciples,1.0
26789,Judas then having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees came there with lanterns torches and weapons,1.0
26791,They answered him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus said to them I AM Judas also who betrayed him was standing with them,1.0
26792,When therefore he said to them I AM they went backward and fell to the ground,1.0
26794,Jesus answered I told you that I AM If therefore you seek me let these go their way,1.0
26795,that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke Of those whom you have given me I have lost none,1.0
26796,Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it and struck the high priests servant and cut off his right ear The servants name was Malchus,1.0
26801,Simon Peter followed Jesus as did another disciple Now that disciple was known to the high priest and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest,1.0
26802,but Peter was standing at the door outside So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to her who kept the door and brought in Peter,1.0
26804,Now the servants and the officers were standing there having made a fire of coals for it was cold They were warming themselves Peter was with them standing and warming himself,1.0
26806,Jesus answered him I spoke openly to the world I always taught in synagogues and in the temple where the Jews always meet I said nothing in secret,1.0
26807,Why do you ask me Ask those who have heard me what I said to them Behold these know the things which I said,1.0
26809,Jesus answered him If I have spoken evil testify of the evil but if well why do you beat me,1.0
26810,Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest,1.0
26811,Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself They said therefore to him You arent also one of his disciples are you He denied it and said I am not,1.0
26812,One of the servants of the high priest being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off said Didnt I see you in the garden with him,1.0
26813,Peter therefore denied it again and immediately the rooster crowed,1.0
26814,They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium It was early and they themselves didnt enter into the Praetorium that they might not be defiled but might eat the Passover,1.0
26816,They answered him If this man werent an evildoer we wouldnt have delivered him up to you,1.0
26817,Pilate therefore said to them Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law Therefore the Jews said to him It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,1.0
26819,Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium called Jesus and said to him Are you the King of the Jews,1.0
26820,Jesus answered him Do you say this by yourself or did others tell you about me,1.0
26821,Pilate answered Im not a Jew am I Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me What have you done,1.0
26823,Pilate therefore said to him Are you a king then Jesus answered You say that I am a king For this reason I have been born and for this reason I have come into the world that I should testify to the truth Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice,1.0
26824,Pilate said to him What is truth When he had said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them I find no basis for a charge against him,1.0
26825,But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews,1.0
26826,Then they all shouted again saying Not this man but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber,1.0
26829,They kept saying Hail King of the Jews! and they kept slapping him,1.0
26831,Jesus therefore came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment Pilate said to them Behold the man!,1.0
26832,When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they shouted saying Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them Take him yourselves and crucify him for I find no basis for a charge against him,1.0
26833,The Jews answered him We have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God,1.0
26834,When therefore Pilate heard this saying he was more afraid,1.0
26837,Jesus answered You would have no power at all against me unless it were given to you from above Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin,1.0
26840,Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover at about the sixth hour{noon} He said to the Jews Behold your King!,1.0
26841,They cried out Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! Pilate said to them Shall I crucify your King The chief priests answered We have no king but Caesar!,1.0
26842,So then he delivered him to them to be crucified So they took Jesus and led him away,1.0
26847,The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate Dont write The King of the Jews but he said I am King of the Jews,1.0
26849,Then the soldiers when they had crucified Jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also the coat Now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout,1.0
26850,Then they said to one another Lets not tear it but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says They parted my garments among them For my cloak they cast lots Therefore the soldiers did these things,1.0
26852,Therefore when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there he said to his mother Woman behold your son!,1.0
26853,Then he said to the disciple Behold your mother! From that hour the disciple took her to his own home,1.0
26854,After this Jesus seeing{NU TR read knowing instead of seeing} that all things were now finished that the Scripture might be fulfilled said I am thirsty,1.0
26856,When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said It is finished He bowed his head and gave up his spirit,1.0
26857,Therefore the Jews because it was the Preparation Day so that the bodies wouldnt remain on the cross on the Sabbath for that Sabbath was a special one asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away,1.0
26859,but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead they didnt break his legs,1.0
26860,However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out,1.0
26861,He who has seen has testified and his testimony is true He knows that he tells the truth that you may believe,1.0
26862,For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled A bone of him will not be broken,1.0
26863,Again another Scripture says They will look on him whom they pierced,1.0
26864,After these things Joseph of Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus body Pilate gave him permission He came therefore and took away his body,1.0
26867,Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden In the garden a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid,1.0
26869,Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went early while it was still dark to the tomb and saw the stone taken away from the tomb,1.0
26870,Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb and we dont know where they have laid him!,1.0
26871,Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out and they went toward the tomb,1.0
26874,Then Simon Peter came following him and entered into the tomb He saw the linen cloths lying,1.0
26876,So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in and he saw and believed,1.0
26878,So the disciples went away again to their own homes,1.0
26882,When she had said this she turned around and saw Jesus standing and didnt know that it was Jesus,1.0
26883,Jesus said to her Woman why are you weeping Who are you looking for She supposing him to be the gardener said to him Sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away,1.0
26884,Jesus said to her Mary She turned and said to him Rhabbouni! which is to say Teacher!,1.0
26886,Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her,1.0
26888,When he had said this he showed them his hands and his side The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord,1.0
26890,When he had said this he breathed on them and said to them Receive the Holy Spirit!,1.0
26891,Whoevers sins you forgive they are forgiven them Whoevers sins you retain they have been retained,1.0
26895,Then he said to Thomas Reach here your finger and see my hands Reach here your hand and put it into my side Dont be unbelieving but believing,1.0
26898,Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book,1.0
26900,After these things Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias He revealed himself this way,1.0
26901,Simon Peter Thomas called Didymus Nathanael of Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were together,1.0
26902,Simon Peter said to them Im going fishing They told him We are also coming with you They immediately went out and entered into the boat That night they caught nothing,1.0
26903,But when day had already come Jesus stood on the beach yet the disciples didnt know that it was Jesus,1.0
26906,That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter Its the Lord! So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he wrapped his coat around him for he was naked and threw himself into the sea,1.0
26908,So when they got out on the land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid on it and bread,1.0
26910,Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fish one hundred fiftythree and even though there were so many the net wasnt torn,1.0
26911,Jesus said to them Come and eat breakfast None of the disciples dared inquire of him Who are you knowing that it was the Lord,1.0
26914,So when they had eaten their breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonah do you love me more than these He said to him Yes Lord you know that I have affection for you He said to him Feed my lambs,1.0
26915,He said to him again a second time Simon son of Jonah do you love me He said to him Yes Lord you know that I have affection for you He said to him Tend my sheep,1.0
26917,Most assuredly I tell you when you were young you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted to But when you are old you will stretch out your hands and another will dress you and carry you where you dont want to go,1.0
26918,Now he said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God When he had said this he said to him Follow me,1.0
26919,Then Peter turning around saw a disciple following This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved the one who had also leaned on Jesus breast at the supper and asked Lord who is going to betray You,1.0
26921,Jesus said to him If I desire that he stay until I come what is that to you You follow me,1.0
26922,This saying therefore went out among the brothers{The word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} that this disciple wouldnt die Yet Jesus didnt say to him that he wouldnt die but If I desire that he stay until I come what is that to you,1.0
26925,The first book I wrote Theophilus concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,1.0
26926,until the day in which he was received up after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,1.0
26928,Being assembled together with them he charged them Dont depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which you heard from me,1.0
26929,For John indeed baptized in water but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now,1.0
26930,Therefore when they had come together they asked him Lord are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel,1.0
26931,He said to them It isnt for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within His own authority,1.0
26932,But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem in all Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth,1.0
26933,When he had said these things as they were looking he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight,1.0
26934,While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went behold two men stood by them in white clothing,1.0
26935,who also said You men of Galilee why do you stand looking into the sky This Jesus who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky,1.0
26939,In these days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and the number of names was about one hundred twenty and said,1.0
26941,For he was numbered with us and received his portion in this ministry,1.0
26942,Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness and falling headlong his body burst open and all his intestines gushed out,1.0
26943,It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called Akeldama that is The field of blood,1.0
26945,Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,1.0
26946,beginning from the baptism of John to the day that he was received up from us of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection,1.0
26947,They put forward two Joseph called Barsabbas who was surnamed Justus and Matthias,1.0
26949,to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away that he might go to his own place,1.0
26950,They drew lots for them and the lot fell on Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles,1.0
26951,Now when the day of Pentecost had come they were all with one accord in one place,1.0
26953,Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them and one sat on each of them,1.0
26956,When this sound was heard the multitude came together and were bewildered because everyone heard them speaking in his own language,1.0
26957,They were all amazed and marveled saying to one another Behold arent all these who speak Galileans,1.0
26960,Phrygia Pamphylia Egypt the parts of Libya around Cyrene visitors from Rome both Jews and proselytes,1.0
26963,Others mocking said They are filled with new wine,1.0
26969,I will show wonders in the sky above And signs on the earth beneath Blood and fire and billows of smoke,1.0
26970,The sun will be turned into darkness And the moon into blood Before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes,1.0
26971,It will be that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved,1.0
26974,whom God raised up having freed him from the agony of death because it was not possible that he should be held by it,1.0
26977,Because you will not leave my soul in Hades Neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay,1.0
26978,You made known to me the ways of life You will make me full of gladness with your presence,1.0
26979,Brothers I may tell you freely of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day,1.0
26980,Therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body according to the flesh he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,1.0
26982,This Jesus God raised up to which we all are witnesses,1.0
26984,For David didnt ascend into the heavens but he says himself The Lord said to my Lord Sit by my right hand,1.0
26986,Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified,1.0
26987,Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles Brothers what shall we do,1.0
26988,Peter said to them Repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,1.0
26989,For to you is the promise and to your children and to all who are far off even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself,1.0
26990,With many other words he testified and exhorted them saying Save yourselves from this crooked generation!,1.0
26992,They continued steadfastly in the apostles teaching and fellowship in the breaking of bread and prayer,1.0
26994,All who believed were together and had all things in common,1.0
26995,They sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all according as anyone had need,1.0
26998,Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer the ninth hour{300 PM},1.0
26999,A certain man who was lame from his mothers womb was being carried whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple,1.0
27000,Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple he asked to receive gifts for the needy,1.0
27001,Peter fastening his eyes on him with John said Look at us,1.0
27002,He listened to them expecting to receive something from them,1.0
27003,But Peter said Silver and gold have I none but what I have that I give you In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth get up and walk!,1.0
27004,He took him by the right hand and raised him up Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength,1.0
27005,Leaping up he stood and began to walk He entered with them into the temple walking leaping and praising God,1.0
27006,All the people saw him walking and praising God,1.0
27007,They recognized him that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him,1.0
27008,As the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomons greatly wondering,1.0
27009,When Peter saw it he responded to the people You men of Israel why do you marvel at this man Why do you fasten your eyes on us as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk,1.0
27011,But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,1.0
27012,and killed the Prince of life whom God raised from the dead to which we are witnesses,1.0
27013,By faith in his name has his name made this man strong whom you see and know Yes the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all,1.0
27019,For Moses indeed said to the fathers The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers like me You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you,1.0
27020,It will be that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people,1.0
27021,Yes and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after as many as have spoken they also told of these days,1.0
27022,You are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers saying to Abraham In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed,1.0
27023,God having raised up his servant Jesus sent him to you first to bless you in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness,1.0
27027,But many of those who heard the word believed and the number of the men came to be about five thousand,1.0
27032,if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man by what means this man has been healed,1.0
27033,be it known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead in him does this man stand here before you whole,1.0
27035,There is salvation in none other for neither is there any other name under heaven that is given among men by which we must be saved!,1.0
27036,Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled They recognized that they had been with Jesus,1.0
27037,Seeing the man who was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it,1.0
27040,But so that this spreads no further among the people lets threaten them that from now on they dont speak to anyone in this name,1.0
27041,They called them and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus,1.0
27042,But Peter and John answered them Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God judge for yourselves,1.0
27043,for we cant help telling the things which we saw and heard,1.0
27044,When they had further threatened them they let them go finding no way to punish them because of the people for everyone glorified God for that which was done,1.0
27045,For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old,1.0
27046,Being let go they came to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them,1.0
27047,When they heard it they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said O Lord you are God who made the heaven the earth the sea and all that is in them,1.0
27048,who by the mouth of your servant David said Why do the nations rage And the peoples plot a vain thing,1.0
27049,The kings of the earth take a stand And the rulers take council together Against the Lord and against his Christ{Christ Greek and Messiah Hebrew both mean Anointed One Compare Psalm 2},1.0
27050,For truly in this city against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together,1.0
27051,to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen,1.0
27055,The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common,1.0
27056,With great power the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Great grace was on them all,1.0
27057,For neither was there among them any who lacked for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,1.0
27059,Joses who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas which is being interpreted Son of Encouragement a Levite a man of Cyprus by race,1.0
27060,having a field sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet,1.0
27062,and kept back part of the price his wife also being aware of it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet,1.0
27063,But Peter said Ananias why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the price of the land,1.0
27064,While you kept it didnt it remain your own After it was sold wasnt it in your power How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart You havent lied to men but to God,1.0
27066,The young men arose and wrapped him up and they carried him out and buried him,1.0
27067,About three hours later his wife not knowing what had happened came in,1.0
27068,Peter answered her Tell me whether you sold the land for so much She said Yes for so much,1.0
27069,But Peter asked her How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord Behold the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out,1.0
27072,By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people They were all with one accord in Solomons porch,1.0
27073,None of the rest dared to join them however the people honored them,1.0
27074,More believers were added to the Lord multitudes of both men and women,1.0
27075,They even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mattresses so that as Peter came by at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them,1.0
27078,and laid hands on the apostles and put them in public custody,1.0
27079,But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night and brought them out and said,1.0
27081,When they heard this they entered into the temple about daybreak and taught But the high priest came and those who were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought,1.0
27084,Now when the high priest the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this,1.0
27085,One came and told them Behold the men whom you put in prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people,1.0
27088,saying Didnt we strictly charge you not to teach in this name Behold you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this mans blood on us,1.0
27089,But Peter and the apostles answered We must obey God rather than men,1.0
27092,We are His witnesses of these things and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him,1.0
27093,But they when they heard this were cut to the heart and determined to kill them,1.0
27094,But one stood up in the council a Pharisee named Gamaliel a teacher of the law honored by all the people and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while,1.0
27095,He said to them You men of Israel be careful concerning these men what you are about to do,1.0
27096,For before these days Theudas rose up making himself out to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were dispersed and came to nothing,1.0
27097,After this man Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment and drew away some people after him He also perished and all as many as obeyed him were scattered abroad,1.0
27102,Every day in the temple and at home they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus the Christ,1.0
27103,Now in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplying a complaint arose from the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily service,1.0
27105,Therefore select from among you brothers seven men of good report full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom whom we may appoint over this business,1.0
27106,But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word,1.0
27107,These words pleased the whole multitude They chose Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit Philip Prochorus Nicanor Timon Parmenas and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch,1.0
27111,But some of those who were of the synagogue called The Libertines and of the Cyrenians of the Alexandrians and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose disputing with Stephen,1.0
27112,They werent able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke,1.0
27113,Then they secretly induced men to say We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God,1.0
27117,All who sat in the council fastening their eyes on him saw his face like it was the face of an angel,1.0
27120,and said to him Get out of your land and from your relatives and come into a land which I will show you,1.0
27122,He gave him no inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on He promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when he still had no child,1.0
27123,God spoke in this way that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years,1.0
27124,I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage said God and after that will they come out and serve me in this place,1.0
27126,The patriarchs moved with jealousy against Joseph sold him into Egypt God was with him,1.0
27127,and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt He made him governor over Egypt and all his house,1.0
27128,Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan and great affliction Our fathers found no food,1.0
27135,until there arose a different king who didnt know Joseph,1.0
27136,The same took advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers and forced them to throw out their babies so that they wouldnt stay alive,1.0
27139,Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians He was mighty in his words and works,1.0
27140,But when he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brothers{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} the children of Israel,1.0
27141,Seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him who was oppressed striking the Egyptian,1.0
27142,He supposed that his brothers understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance but they didnt understand,1.0
27144,But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away saying Who made you a ruler and a judge over us,1.0
27145,Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday,1.0
27149,I am the God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob Moses trembled and dared not look,1.0
27151,I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt and have heard their groaning I have come down to deliver them Now come I will send you into Egypt,1.0
27154,This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers like me{TR adds You shall listen to him},1.0
27155,This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our fathers who received living oracles to give to us,1.0
27156,to whom our fathers wouldnt be obedient but rejected him and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,1.0
27157,saying to Aaron Make us gods that will go before us for as for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt we dont know what has become of him,1.0
27158,They made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced in the works of their hands,1.0
27160,You took up the tent of Moloch The star of your god Rephan The figures which you made to worship I will carry you away beyond Babylon,1.0
27161,Our fathers had the tent of the testimony in the wilderness even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen,1.0
27162,which also our fathers in their turn brought in with Joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations whom God drove out before the face of our fathers to the days of David,1.0
27164,But Solomon built him a house,1.0
27165,However the Most High doesnt dwell in temples made with hands as the prophet says,1.0
27168,You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did so you do,1.0
27169,Which of the prophets didnt your fathers persecute They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers,1.0
27170,You received the law as it was ordained by angels and didnt keep it!,1.0
27171,Now when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed at him with their teeth,1.0
27174,But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed at him with one accord,1.0
27175,They threw him out of the city and stoned him The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul,1.0
27177,He kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord dont hold this sin against them! When he had said this he fell asleep,1.0
27178,Saul was consenting to his death A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except for the apostles,1.0
27180,But Saul ravaged the assembly entering into every house and dragged both men and women off to prison,1.0
27181,Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word,1.0
27182,Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ,1.0
27183,The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip when they heard and saw the signs which he did,1.0
27184,For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them They came out crying with a loud voice Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed,1.0
27185,There was great joy in that city,1.0
27187,to whom they all listened from the least to the greatest saying This man is that great power of God,1.0
27189,But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women,1.0
27191,Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent Peter and John to them,1.0
27192,who when they had come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,1.0
27193,for as yet he had fallen on none of them They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus,1.0
27194,Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit,1.0
27196,saying Give me also this power that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit,1.0
27197,But Peter said to him May your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!,1.0
27199,Repent therefore of this your wickedness and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you,1.0
27201,Simon answered Pray for me to the Lord that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me,1.0
27202,They therefore when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord returned to Jerusalem and preached the Gospel to many villages of the Samaritans,1.0
27206,The Spirit said to Philip Go near and join yourself to this chariot,1.0
27207,Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said Do you understand what you are reading,1.0
27208,He said How can I unless someone explains it to me He begged Philip to come up and sit with him,1.0
27212,Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this Scripture preached to him Jesus,1.0
27213,As they went on the way they came to some water and the eunuch said Behold here is water What is keeping me from being baptized,1.0
27214,{TR adds Philip said If you believe with all your heart you may He answered I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God},1.0
27216,When they came up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away and the eunuch didnt see him any more for he went on his way rejoicing,1.0
27219,and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus that if he found any who were of the Way whether men or women he might bring them bound to Jerusalem,1.0
27223,But{TR omits But } rise up and enter into the city and you will be told what you must do,1.0
27224,The men who traveled with him stood speechless hearing the sound but seeing no one,1.0
27225,Saul arose from the ground and when his eyes were opened he saw no one They led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus,1.0
27227,Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias The Lord said to him in a vision Ananias! He said Behold its me Lord,1.0
27228,The Lord said to him Arise and go to the street which is called Straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul a man of Tarsus For behold he is praying,1.0
27229,and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him that he might receive his sight,1.0
27230,But Ananias answered Lord I have heard from many about this man how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem,1.0
27232,But the Lord said to him Go your way for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings and the children of Israel,1.0
27233,For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my names sake,1.0
27234,Ananias departed and entered into the house Laying his hands on him he said Brother Saul the Lord who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit,1.0
27237,Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ that he is the Son of God,1.0
27239,But Saul increased more in strength and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus proving that this is the Christ,1.0
27243,When Saul had come to Jerusalem he tried to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him not believing that he was a disciple,1.0
27245,He was with them entering into{TR and NU add and going out} Jerusalem,1.0
27249,It happened as Peter went throughout all those parts he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda,1.0
27251,Peter said to him Aeneas Jesus Christ heals you Get up and make your bed! Immediately he arose,1.0
27252,All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him and they turned to the Lord,1.0
27255,As Lydda was near Joppa the disciples hearing that Peter was there sent two men{Reading from NU TR MT omits two men} to him imploring him not to delay in coming to them,1.0
27256,Peter got up and went with them When he had come they brought him into the upper chamber All the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them,1.0
27263,At about the ninth hour of the day{300 PM} he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him Cornelius!,1.0
27264,He fastening his eyes on him and being frightened said What is it Lord He said to him Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God,1.0
27265,Now send men to Joppa and get Simon who is surnamed Peter,1.0
27267,When the angel who spoke to him had departed Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually,1.0
27271,He saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,1.0
27273,A voice came to him Rise Peter kill and eat!,1.0
27274,But Peter said Not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean,1.0
27277,Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean behold the men who were sent by Cornelius having made inquiry for Simons house stood before the gate,1.0
27278,and called and asked whether Simon who was surnamed Peter was lodging there,1.0
27279,While Peter was pondering the vision the Spirit said to him Behold three{Reading from TR and NU MT omits three} men seek you,1.0
27280,But arise get down and go with them doubting nothing for I have sent them,1.0
27282,They said Cornelius a centurion a righteous man and one who fears God and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house and to listen to what you say,1.0
27283,So he called them in and lodged them On the next day Peter arose and went out with them and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him,1.0
27284,On the next day they entered into Caesarea Cornelius was waiting for them having called together his relatives and his near friends,1.0
27285,When it happened that Peter entered Cornelius met him fell down at his feet and worshiped him,1.0
27288,He said to them You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation but God has shown me that I shouldnt call any man unholy or unclean,1.0
27289,Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for I ask therefore why did you send for me,1.0
27291,and said Cornelius your prayer is heard and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God,1.0
27292,Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon who is surnamed Peter He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner by the seaside When he comes he will speak to you,1.0
27293,Therefore I sent to you at once and it was good of you to come Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God,1.0
27294,Peter opened his mouth and said Truly I perceive that God doesnt show favoritism,1.0
27298,even Jesus of Nazareth how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for God was with him,1.0
27299,We are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they also{TR omits also} killed hanging him on a tree,1.0
27300,God raised him up the third day and gave him to be revealed,1.0
27301,not to all the people but to witnesses who were chosen before by God to us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead,1.0
27305,They of the circumcision who believed were amazed as many as came with Peter because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles,1.0
27306,For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God Then Peter answered,1.0
27307,Can any man forbid the water that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized,1.0
27308,He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Then they asked him to stay some days,1.0
27309,Now the apostles and the brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God,1.0
27312,But Peter began and explained to them in order saying,1.0
27314,When I had looked intently at it I considered and saw the fourfooted animals of the earth wild animals creeping things and birds of the sky,1.0
27317,But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven What God has cleansed dont you call unclean,1.0
27318,This was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven,1.0
27320,The Spirit told me to go with them without discriminating These six brothers also accompanied me and we entered into the mans house,1.0
27321,He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying to him Send to Joppa and get Simon whose surname is Peter,1.0
27322,who will speak to you words by which you will be saved you and all your house,1.0
27323,As I began to speak the Holy Spirit fell on them even as on us at the beginning,1.0
27324,I remembered the word of the Lord how he said John indeed baptized in water but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit,1.0
27325,If then God gave to them the same gift as us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ who was I that I could withstand God,1.0
27326,When they heard these things they held their peace and glorified God saying Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!,1.0
27327,They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia Cyprus and Antioch speaking the word to no one except to Jews only,1.0
27328,But there were some of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene who when they had come to Antioch spoke to the Greeks preaching the Lord Jesus,1.0
27331,who when he had come and had seen the grace of God was glad He exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the Lord,1.0
27333,Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saul,1.0
27336,One of them named Agabus stood up and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world which also happened in the days of Claudius,1.0
27337,As any of the disciples had plenty each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea,1.0
27340,He killed James the brother of John with the sword,1.0
27342,When he had arrested him he put him in prison and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover,1.0
27343,Peter therefore was kept in the prison but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him,1.0
27345,And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shone in the cell He struck Peter on the side and woke him up saying Stand up quickly! His chains fell off from his hands,1.0
27347,And he went out and followed him He didnt know that what was being done by the angel was real but thought he saw a vision,1.0
27351,When Peter knocked at the door of the gate a maid named Rhoda came to answer,1.0
27352,When she recognized Peters voice she didnt open the gate for joy but ran in and reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate,1.0
27354,But Peter continued knocking When they had opened they saw him and were amazed,1.0
27355,But he beckoning to them with his hand to be silent declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison He said Tell these things to James and to the brothers Then he departed and went to another place,1.0
27356,Now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter,1.0
27357,When Herod had sought for him and didnt find him he examined the guards and commanded that they should be put to death He went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there,1.0
27358,Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon They came with one accord to him and having made Blastus the kings chamberlain their friend they asked for peace because their country depended on the kings country for food,1.0
27362,But the word of God grew and multiplied,1.0
27364,Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers Barnabas Simeon who was called Niger Lucius of Cyrene Manaen the fosterbrother of Herod the tetrarch and Saul,1.0
27366,Then when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away,1.0
27367,So being sent out by the Holy Spirit they went down to Seleucia From there they sailed to Cyprus,1.0
27370,who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus a man of understanding This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God,1.0
27371,But Elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith,1.0
27372,But Saul who is also called Paul filled with the Holy Spirit fastened his eyes on him,1.0
27375,Then the proconsul when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the teaching of the Lord,1.0
27376,Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem,1.0
27379,Paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said Men of Israel and you who fear God listen,1.0
27382,When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan he gave them their land for an inheritance for about four hundred fifty years,1.0
27383,After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet,1.0
27385,When he had removed him he raised up David to be their king to whom he also testified I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my heart who will do all my will,1.0
27386,From this mans seed God has brought salvation{TR NU read a Savior Jesus instead of salvation} to Israel according to his promise,1.0
27387,before his coming when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel{TR NU read to all the people of Israel instead of to Israel},1.0
27388,As John was fulfilling his course he said What do you suppose that I am I am not he But behold one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie,1.0
27390,For those who dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers because they didnt know him nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath fulfilled them by condemning him,1.0
27391,Though they found no cause for death they still asked Pilate to have him killed,1.0
27392,When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb,1.0
27397,Concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he has spoken thus I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David,1.0
27398,Therefore he says also in another psalm You will not allow your Holy One to see decay,1.0
27402,and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses,1.0
27403,Beware therefore lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets,1.0
27405,So when the Jews went out of the synagogue the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath,1.0
27406,Now when the synagogue broke up many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to them urged them to continue in the grace of God,1.0
27407,The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God,1.0
27408,But when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with jealousy and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul and blasphemed,1.0
27409,Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said It was necessary that Gods word should be spoken to you first Since indeed you thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life behold we turn to the Gentiles,1.0
27413,But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them out of their borders,1.0
27415,The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit,1.0
27416,It happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed,1.0
27417,But the disbelieving{or disobedient} Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers,1.0
27418,Therefore they stayed there a long time speaking boldly in the Lord who testified to the word of his grace granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands,1.0
27421,they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia Lystra Derbe and the surrounding region,1.0
27423,At Lystra a certain man sat impotent in his feet a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked,1.0
27424,He was listening to Paul speaking who fastening eyes on him and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,1.0
27427,They called Barnabas Jupiter and Paul Mercury because he was the chief speaker,1.0
27428,The priest of Jupiter whose temple was in front of their city brought oxen and garlands to the gates and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes,1.0
27429,But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it they tore their clothes and sprang into the multitude crying out,1.0
27430,Men why are you doing these things We also are men of like passions with you and bring you good news that you should turn from these vain things to the living God who made the sky and the earth and the sea and all that is in them,1.0
27431,who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways,1.0
27432,Yet he didnt leave himself without witness in that he did good and gave you{TR reads us instead of you} rains from the sky and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness,1.0
27433,Even saying these things they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them,1.0
27434,But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there and having persuaded the multitudes they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,1.0
27435,But as the disciples stood around him he rose up and entered into the city On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe,1.0
27437,confirming the souls of the disciples exhorting them to continue in the faith and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God,1.0
27439,They passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia,1.0
27444,Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses you cant be saved,1.0
27446,They being sent on their way by the assembly passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles They caused great joy to all the brothers{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings},1.0
27449,The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter,1.0
27452,He made no distinction between us and them cleansing their hearts by faith,1.0
27453,Now therefore why do you tempt God that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear,1.0
27454,But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ} just as they are,1.0
27458,This agrees with the words of the prophets As it is written,1.0
27459,After these things I will return I will again build the tent of David which has fallen I will again build its ruins I will set it up,1.0
27460,That the rest of men may seek after the Lord All the Gentiles who are called by my name Says the Lord who does all these things,1.0
27461,All his works are known to God from eternity,1.0
27463,but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols from sexual immorality from what is strangled and from blood,1.0
27464,For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him being read in the synagogues every Sabbath,1.0
27466,They wrote these things by their hand The apostles the elders and the brothers to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch Syria and Cilicia greetings,1.0
27468,it seemed good to us having come to one accord to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,1.0
27469,men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
27470,We have sent therefore Judas and Silas who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth,1.0
27472,that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols from blood from things strangled and from sexual immorality from which if you keep yourselves it will be well with you Farewell,1.0
27473,So when they were sent off they came to Antioch Having gathered the multitude together they delivered the letter,1.0
27474,When they had read it they rejoiced over the encouragement,1.0
27475,Judas and Silas also being prophets themselves encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them,1.0
27476,After they had spent some time there they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles,1.0
27479,After some days Paul said to Barnabas Lets return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord to see how they are doing,1.0
27480,Barnabas planned to take John who was called Mark with them also,1.0
27482,Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,1.0
27483,but Paul chose Silas and went out being commended by the brothers to the grace of God,1.0
27484,He went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the assemblies,1.0
27485,He came to Derbe and Lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named Timothy the son of a Jewess who believed but his father was a Greek,1.0
27486,The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him,1.0
27489,So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith and increased in number daily,1.0
27491,When they had come opposite Mysia they tried to go into Bithynia but the Spirit didnt allow them,1.0
27492,Passing by Mysia they came down to Troas,1.0
27495,Setting sail therefore from Troas we made a straight course to Samothrace and the day following to Neapolis,1.0
27496,and from there to Philippi which is a city of Macedonia the foremost of the district a Roman colony We were staying some days in this city,1.0
27497,On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside where we supposed there was a place of prayer and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together,1.0
27498,A certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira one who worshiped God heard us whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul,1.0
27499,When she and her household were baptized she begged us saying If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come into my house and stay So she persuaded us,1.0
27502,She was doing this for many days But Paul becoming greatly annoyed turned and said to the spirit I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! It came out that very hour,1.0
27505,and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe being Romans,1.0
27506,The multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them and commanded them to be beaten with rods,1.0
27507,When they had laid many stripes on them they threw them into prison charging the jailer to keep them safely,1.0
27509,But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God and the prisoners were listening to them,1.0
27510,Suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyones bonds were loosened,1.0
27511,The jailer being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open drew his sword and was about to kill himself supposing that the prisoners had escaped,1.0
27515,They said Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved you and your household,1.0
27516,They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house,1.0
27517,He took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was immediately baptized he and all his household,1.0
27519,But when it was day the magistrates sent the sergeants saying Let those men go,1.0
27520,The jailer reported these words to Paul saying The magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore come out and go in peace,1.0
27521,But Paul said to them They have beaten us publicly without a trial men who are Romans and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly No most assuredly but let them come themselves and bring us out!,1.0
27522,The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,1.0
27524,They went out of the prison and entered into Lydias house When they had seen the brothers they encouraged them and departed,1.0
27525,Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews,1.0
27528,Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas of the devout Greeks a great multitude and not a few of the chief women,1.0
27529,But the unpersuaded Jews took along{TR reads And the Jews who were unpersuaded becoming envious and taking along instead of But the unpersuaded Jews took along} some wicked men from the marketplace and gathering a crowd set the city in an uproar Assaulting the house of Jason they sought to bring them out to the people,1.0
27530,When they didnt find them they dragged Jason and certain brothers{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} before the rulers of the city crying These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,1.0
27531,whom Jason has received These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar saying that there is another king Jesus!,1.0
27532,The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things,1.0
27533,When they had taken security from Jason and the rest they let them go,1.0
27535,Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so,1.0
27536,Many of them therefore believed also of the prominent Greek women and not a few men,1.0
27537,But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also they came there likewise agitating the multitudes,1.0
27538,Then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea and Silas and Timothy still stayed there,1.0
27539,But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly they departed,1.0
27540,Now while Paul waited for them at Athens his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols,1.0
27541,So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons and in the marketplace every day with those who met him,1.0
27543,They took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus saying May we know what this new teaching is which is spoken by you,1.0
27548,The God who made the world and all things in it he being Lord of heaven and earth doesnt dwell in temples made with hands,1.0
27549,neither is he served by mens hands as though he needed anything seeing he himself gives to all life and breath and all things,1.0
27550,He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth having determined appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwellings,1.0
27552,For in him we live and move and have our being As some of your own poets have said For we are also his offspring,1.0
27553,Being then the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone engraved by art and design of man,1.0
27554,The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,1.0
27555,because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained of which he has given assurance to all men in that he has raised him from the dead,1.0
27557,Thus Paul went out from among them,1.0
27558,But certain men joined with him and believed among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them,1.0
27561,and because he practiced the same trade he lived with them and worked for by trade they were tent makers,1.0
27562,He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks,1.0
27563,But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia Paul was compelled by the Spirit testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ,1.0
27565,He departed there and went into the house of a certain man named Justus one who worshiped God whose house was next door to the synagogue,1.0
27566,Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house Many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized,1.0
27567,The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision Dont be afraid but speak and dont be silent,1.0
27569,He lived there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them,1.0
27573,but if they are questions about words and names and your own law look to it yourselves For I dont want to be a judge of these matters,1.0
27574,He drove them from the judgment seat,1.0
27575,Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat Gallio didnt care about any of these things,1.0
27576,Paul having stayed after this many more days took his leave of the brothers{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} and sailed from there for Syria together with Priscilla and Aquila He shaved his head in Cenchreae for he had a vow,1.0
27577,He came to Ephesus and he left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews,1.0
27579,but taking his leave of them and saying I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem but I will return again to you if God wills he set sail from Ephesus,1.0
27580,When he had landed at Caesarea he went up and greeted the assembly and went down to Antioch,1.0
27581,Having spent some time there he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order establishing all the disciples,1.0
27583,This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in spirit he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus although he knew only the baptism of John,1.0
27584,He began to speak boldly in the synagogue But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately,1.0
27585,When he had determined to pass over into Achaia the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to receive him When he had come he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,1.0
27587,It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus and found certain disciples,1.0
27588,He said to them Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed They said to him No we havent even heard that there is a Holy Spirit,1.0
27589,He said Into what then were you baptized They said Into Johns baptism,1.0
27590,Paul said John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him that is in Jesus,1.0
27591,When they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,1.0
27592,When Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with other languages and prophesied,1.0
27593,They were about twelve men in all,1.0
27595,But when some were hardened and disobedient speaking evil of the Way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus,1.0
27596,This continued for two years so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and Greeks,1.0
27598,so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick and the evil spirits went out,1.0
27599,But some of the itinerant Jews exorcists took on themselves to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches,1.0
27602,The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overpowered them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded,1.0
27604,Many also of those who had believed came confessing and declaring their deeds,1.0
27606,So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty,1.0
27607,Now after these things had ended Paul determined in the spirit when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia to go to Jerusalem saying After I have been there I must also see Rome,1.0
27609,About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way,1.0
27610,For a certain man named Demetrius a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis brought no little business to the craftsmen,1.0
27612,You see and hear that not at Ephesus alone but almost throughout all Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people saying that they are no gods that are made with hands,1.0
27613,Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing and her majesty destroyed whom all Asia and the world worships,1.0
27614,When they heard this they were filled with anger and cried out saying Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!,1.0
27616,When Paul wanted to enter in to the people the disciples didnt allow him,1.0
27618,Some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was in confusion Most of them didnt know why they had come together,1.0
27620,But when they perceived that he was a Jew all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!,1.0
27622,Seeing then that these things cant be denied you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rash,1.0
27623,For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess,1.0
27624,If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone the courts are open and there are proconsuls Let them press charges against one another,1.0
27625,But if you seek anything about other matters it will be settled in the regular assembly,1.0
27626,For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this days riot there being no cause Concerning it we wouldnt be able to give an account of this commotion,1.0
27627,When he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly,1.0
27629,When he had gone through those parts and had encouraged them with many words he came into Greece,1.0
27630,When he had spent three months there and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria he determined to return through Macedonia,1.0
27631,These accompanied him as far as Asia Sopater of Beroea Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians Gaius of Derbe Timothy and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia,1.0
27633,We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread and came to them at Troas in five days where we stayed seven days,1.0
27636,A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window weighed down with deep sleep As Paul spoke still longer being weighed down by his sleep he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead,1.0
27637,Paul went down and fell upon him and embracing him said Dont be troubled for his life is in him,1.0
27638,When he had gone up and had broken bread and eaten and had talked with them a long while even until break of day he departed,1.0
27641,When he met us at Assos we took him aboard and came to Mitylene,1.0
27642,Sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium and the day after we came to Miletus,1.0
27643,For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus that he might not have to spend time in Asia for he was hastening if it were possible for him to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost,1.0
27644,From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the assembly,1.0
27645,When they had come to him he said to them You yourselves know from the first day that I set foot in Asia how I was with you all the time,1.0
27646,serving the Lord with all humility with many tears and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews,1.0
27648,testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ},1.0
27649,Now behold I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem not knowing what will happen to me there,1.0
27650,except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me,1.0
27651,But these things dont count nor do I hold my life dear to myself so that I may finish my race with joy and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus to fully testify to the Gospel of the grace of God,1.0
27652,Now behold I know that you all among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God will see my face no more,1.0
27653,Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men,1.0
27654,for I didnt shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God,1.0
27656,For I know that after my departure vicious wolves will enter in among you not sparing the flock,1.0
27658,Therefore watch remembering that for a period of three years I didnt cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears,1.0
27659,Now brothers{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} I entrust you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified,1.0
27661,You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me,1.0
27662,In all things I gave you an example that so laboring you ought to help the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said It is more blessed to give than to receive,1.0
27663,When he had spoken these things he knelt down and prayed with them all,1.0
27664,They all wept a lot and fell on Pauls neck and kissed him,1.0
27665,sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken that they should see his face no more And they accompanied him to the ship,1.0
27666,When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail we came with a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara,1.0
27668,When we had come in sight of Cyprus leaving it on the left hand we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre for there the ship was to unload her cargo,1.0
27669,Having found disciples we stayed there seven days These said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem,1.0
27672,When we had finished the voyage from Tyre we arrived at Ptolemais We greeted the brothers and stayed with them one day,1.0
27673,On the next day we who were Pauls companions departed and came to Caesarea We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist who was one of the seven and stayed with him,1.0
27674,Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied,1.0
27675,As we stayed there some days a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea,1.0
27678,Then Paul answered What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart For I am ready not only to be bound but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus,1.0
27680,After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem,1.0
27682,When we had come to Jerusalem the brothers received us gladly,1.0
27684,When he had greeted them he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry,1.0
27685,They when they heard it glorified God They said to him You see brother how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed and they are all zealous for the law,1.0
27688,Therefore do what we tell you We have four men who have taken a vow,1.0
27689,Take them and purify yourself with them and pay their expenses for them that they may shave their heads Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you but that you yourself also walk keeping the law,1.0
27691,Then Paul took the men and the next day purified himself and went with them into the temple declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification until the offering was offered for every one of them,1.0
27692,When the seven days were almost completed the Jews from Asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,1.0
27693,crying out Men of Israel help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place Moreover he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place!,1.0
27694,For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple,1.0
27695,All the city was moved and the people ran together They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple Immediately the doors were shut,1.0
27696,As they were trying to kill him news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar,1.0
27697,Immediately he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them They when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers stopped beating Paul,1.0
27700,When he came to the stairs it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,1.0
27701,for the multitude of the people followed after crying out Away with him!,1.0
27702,As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks he asked the commanding officer May I speak to you He said Do you know Greek,1.0
27704,But Paul said I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia a citizen of no insignificant city I beg you allow me to speak to the people,1.0
27705,When he had given him permission Paul standing on the stairs beckoned with his hand to the people When there was a great silence he spoke to them in the Hebrew language saying,1.0
27707,When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language they were even more quiet He said,1.0
27709,I persecuted this Way to the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,1.0
27711,It happened that as I made my journey and came close to Damascus about noon suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me,1.0
27713,I answered Who are you Lord He said to me I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you persecute,1.0
27714,Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid but they didnt understand the voice of him who spoke to me,1.0
27715,I said What shall I do Lord The Lord said to me Arise and go into Damascus There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do,1.0
27717,One Ananias a devout man according to the law well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,1.0
27719,He said The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth,1.0
27720,For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard,1.0
27721,Now why do you wait Arise be baptized and wash away your sins calling on the name of the Lord,1.0
27722,It happened that when I had returned to Jerusalem and while I prayed in the temple I fell into a trance,1.0
27723,and saw him saying to me Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you,1.0
27725,When the blood of Stephen your witness was shed I also was standing by and consenting to his death and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him,1.0
27727,They listened to him until he said that then they lifted up their voice and said Rid the earth of this fellow for he isnt fit to live!,1.0
27728,As they cried out and threw off their cloaks and threw dust into the air,1.0
27729,the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks ordering him to be examined by scourging that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that,1.0
27731,When the centurion heard it he went to the commanding officer and told him Watch what you are about to do for this man is a Roman!,1.0
27736,Paul looking steadfastly at the council said Brothers I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day,1.0
27740,Paul said I didnt know brothers that he was high priest For it is written You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people,1.0
27741,But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees he cried out in the council Men and brothers I am a Pharisee a son of Pharisees Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!,1.0
27744,A great clamor arose and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up and contended saying We find no evil in this man But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him lets not fight against God!,1.0
27745,When a great argument arose the commanding officer fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the barracks,1.0
27746,The following night the Lord stood by him and said Cheer up Paul for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem so you must testify also at Rome,1.0
27748,There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy,1.0
27751,But Pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul,1.0
27752,Paul summoned one of the centurions and said Bring this young man to the commanding officer for he has something to tell him,1.0
27753,So he took him and brought him to the commanding officer and said Paul the prisoner summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you who has something to tell you,1.0
27754,The commanding officer took him by the hand and going aside asked him privately What is it that you have to tell me,1.0
27755,He said The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him,1.0
27758,He called to himself two of the centurions and said Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea with seventy horsemen and two hundred men armed with spears at the third hour of the night{about 900 PM},1.0
27760,He wrote a letter like this,1.0
27763,Desiring to know the cause why they accused him I brought him down to their council,1.0
27764,I found him to be accused about questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds,1.0
27765,When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man I sent him to you immediately charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you Farewell,1.0
27767,But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the barracks,1.0
27769,When the governor had read it he asked what province he was from When he understood that he was from Cilicia he said,1.0
27770,I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive He commanded that he be kept in Herods palace,1.0
27771,After five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders and an orator one Tertullus They informed the governor against Paul,1.0
27772,When he was called Tertullus began to accuse him saying Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,1.0
27773,we accept it in all ways and in all places most excellent Felix with all thankfulness,1.0
27774,But that I dont delay you I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words,1.0
27775,For we have found this man to be a plague an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,1.0
27776,He even tried to profane the temple and we arrested him{TR adds We wanted to judge him according to our law},1.0
27778,{TR adds commanding his accusers to come to you}By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him,1.0
27779,The Jews also joined in the attack affirming that these things were so,1.0
27780,When the governor had beckoned to him to speak Paul answered Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years I cheerfully make my defense,1.0
27781,seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem,1.0
27782,In the temple they didnt find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd either in the synagogues or in the city,1.0
27783,Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me,1.0
27784,But this I confess to you that after the Way which they call a sect so I serve the God of our fathers believing all things which are according to the law and which are written in the prophets,1.0
27785,having hope toward God which these also themselves look for that there will be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust,1.0
27786,Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men,1.0
27788,amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple not with a mob nor with turmoil,1.0
27790,Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,1.0
27792,But Felix having more exact knowledge concerning the Way deferred them saying When Lysias the commanding officer comes down I will decide your case,1.0
27793,He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody and should have some privileges and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him,1.0
27797,But when two years were fulfilled Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus and desiring to gain favor with the Jews Felix left Paul in bonds,1.0
27799,Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul and they begged him,1.0
27801,However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself was about to depart shortly,1.0
27802,Let them therefore said he that are in power among you go down with me and if there is anything wrong in the man let them accuse him,1.0
27803,When he had stayed among them more than ten days he went down to Caesarea and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought,1.0
27804,When he had come the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,1.0
27805,while he said in his defense Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned at all,1.0
27806,But Festus desiring to gain favor with the Jews answered Paul and said Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged by me there concerning these things,1.0
27810,Now when some days had passed Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus,1.0
27811,As he stayed there many days Festus laid Pauls case before the king saying There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix,1.0
27812,about whom when I was at Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me asking for a sentence against him,1.0
27813,To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction before the accused has met the accusers face to face and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him,1.0
27816,but had certain questions against him about their own religion and about one Jesus who was dead whom Paul affirmed to be alive,1.0
27818,But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar,1.0
27819,Agrippa said to Festus I also would like to hear the man myself Tomorrow he said you shall hear him,1.0
27821,Festus said King Agrippa and all men who are here present with us you see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me both at Jerusalem and here crying that he ought not to live any longer,1.0
27822,But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him,1.0
27823,Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord Therefore I have brought him forth before you and especially before you King Agrippa that after examination I may have something to write,1.0
27824,For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to also specify the charges against him,1.0
27826,I think myself happy King Agrippa that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things that I am accused by the Jews,1.0
27827,especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently,1.0
27828,Indeed all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem,1.0
27829,having known me from the first if they are willing to testify that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee,1.0
27830,Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,1.0
27832,Why is it judged incredible with you if God does raise the dead,1.0
27833,I myself most assuredly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth,1.0
27834,This I also did in Jerusalem I both shut up many of the saints in prisons having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them,1.0
27835,Punishing them often in all the synagogues I tried to make them blaspheme Being exceedingly enraged against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities,1.0
27836,Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,1.0
27838,When we had all fallen to the earth I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language Saul Saul why are you persecuting me It is hard for you to kick against the goads,1.0
27839,I said Who are you Lord He said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,1.0
27842,to open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me,1.0
27846,Having therefore obtained the help that is from God I stand to this day testifying both to small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,1.0
27849,But he said I am not crazy most excellent Festus but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness,1.0
27850,For the king knows of these things to whom also I speak freely For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him for this has not been done in a corner,1.0
27853,Paul said I pray to God that whether with little or with much not only you but also all that hear me this day might become such as I am except for these bonds,1.0
27854,The king rose up with the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them,1.0
27855,When they had withdrawn they spoke one to another saying This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds,1.0
27856,Agrippa said to Festus This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar,1.0
27857,When it was determined that we should sail for Italy they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan band,1.0
27858,Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia we put to sea Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with us,1.0
27859,The next day we touched at Sidon Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself,1.0
27860,Putting to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were contrary,1.0
27861,When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra a city of Lycia,1.0
27862,There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and he put us on board,1.0
27863,When we had sailed slowly many days and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus the wind not allowing us further we sailed under the lee of Crete opposite Salmone,1.0
27864,With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens near the city of Lasea,1.0
27865,When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous because the Fast had now already gone by Paul admonished them,1.0
27867,But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul,1.0
27868,Because the haven was not suitable to winter in the majority advised going to sea from there if by any means they could reach Phoenix and winter there which is a port of Crete looking northeast and southeast,1.0
27869,When the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete close to shore,1.0
27870,But before long a tempestuous wind beat down from shore which is called Euroclydon{Or a northeaster},1.0
27871,When the ship was caught and couldnt face the wind we gave way to it and were driven along,1.0
27872,Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda we were able with difficulty to secure the boat,1.0
27873,After they had hoisted it up they used cables to help reinforce the ship Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven along,1.0
27875,On the third day they threw out the ships tackle with their own hands,1.0
27876,When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days and no small tempest pressed on us all hope that we would be saved was now taken away,1.0
27878,Now I exhort you to cheer up for there will be no loss of life among you but only of the ship,1.0
27882,But we must run aground on a certain island,1.0
27884,They took soundings and found twenty fathoms{20 fathoms  120 feet  366 meters} After a little while they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms{15 fathoms  90 feet  274 meters},1.0
27885,Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground they let go four anchors from the stern and wished for daylight,1.0
27886,As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,1.0
27887,Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers Unless these stay in the ship you cant be saved,1.0
27889,While the day was coming on Paul begged them all to take some food saying This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting having taken nothing,1.0
27890,Therefore I beg you to take some food for this is for your safety for not a hair will perish from any of your heads,1.0
27891,When he had said this and had taken bread he gave thanks to God in the presence of all and he broke it and began to eat,1.0
27892,Then they all cheered up and they also took food,1.0
27896,Casting off the anchors they left them in the sea at the same time untying the rudder ropes Hoisting up the foresail to the wind they made for the beach,1.0
27897,But coming to a place where two seas met they ran the vessel aground The bow struck and remained immovable but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves,1.0
27898,The soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners so that none of them would swim out and escape,1.0
27900,and the rest should follow some on planks and some on other things from the ship So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land,1.0
27903,But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand,1.0
27905,However he shook off the creature into the fire and wasnt harmed,1.0
27906,But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god,1.0
27907,Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island named Publius who received us and courteously entertained us for three days,1.0
27908,It happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery Paul entered in to him prayed and laying his hands on him healed him,1.0
27909,Then when this was done the rest also who had diseases in the island came and were cured,1.0
27911,After three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island whose sign was The Twin Brothers,1.0
27912,Touching at Syracuse we stayed there three days,1.0
27913,From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium After one day a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to Puteoli,1.0
27916,When we entered into Rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him,1.0
27917,It happened that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews When they had come together he said to them I brothers though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,1.0
27919,But when the Jews spoke against it I was constrained to appeal to Caesar not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation,1.0
27920,For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain,1.0
27922,But we desire to hear from you what you think For as concerning this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against,1.0
27923,When they had appointed him a day many people came to him at his lodging He explained to them testifying about the Kingdom of God and persuading them concerning Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets from morning until evening,1.0
27924,Some believed the things which were spoken and some disbelieved,1.0
27925,When they didnt agree among themselves they departed after Paul had spoken one word The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,1.0
27926,saying Go to this people and say In hearing you will hear But will in no way understand In seeing you will see But will in no way perceive,1.0
27928,Be it known therefore to you that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles They will also listen,1.0
27929,When he had said these words the Jews departed having a great dispute among themselves,1.0
27930,Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house and received all who were coming to him,1.0
27931,preaching the Kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness without hinderance,1.0
27932,Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle set apart for the Gospel of God,1.0
27934,concerning his Son who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,1.0
27937,among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ,1.0
27938,to all who are in Rome beloved of God called to be saints Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
27939,First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world,1.0
27941,requesting if by any means now at last I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you,1.0
27942,For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to the end that you may be established,1.0
27944,Now I dont desire to have you unaware brothers that I often planned to come to you and was hindered so far that I might have some fruit among you also even as among the rest of the Gentiles,1.0
27945,I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners both to the wise and to the foolish,1.0
27947,For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes for the Jew first and also for the Greek,1.0
27949,For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,1.0
27950,because that which is known of God is revealed in them for God revealed it to them,1.0
27951,For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen being perceived through the things that are made even his everlasting power and divinity that they may be without excuse,1.0
27953,Professing themselves to be wise they became fools,1.0
27954,and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and fourfooted animals and creeping things,1.0
27955,Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,1.0
27957,For this reason God gave them up to vile passions For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature,1.0
27958,Likewise also the men leaving the natural function of the woman burned in their lust toward one another men doing what is inappropriate with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error,1.0
27960,being filled with all unrighteousness sexual immorality wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder strife deceit evil habits secret slanderers,1.0
27962,without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection unforgiving unmerciful,1.0
27967,Or do you despise the riches of his goodness forbearance and patience not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance,1.0
27969,who will pay back to everyone according to their works,1.0
27975,For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law,1.0
27978,in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience testifying with them and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them,1.0
27981,and know his will and approve the things that are excellent being instructed out of the law,1.0
27982,and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind a light to those who are in darkness,1.0
27984,You therefore who teach another dont you teach yourself You who preach that a man shouldnt steal do you steal,1.0
27988,For circumcision indeed profits if you are a doer of the law but if you are a transgressor of the law your circumcision has become uncircumcision,1.0
27992,but he is a Jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not from men but from God,1.0
27995,For what if some were without faith Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God,1.0
27998,May it never be! For then how will God judge the world,1.0
27999,For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory why am I also still judged as a sinner,1.0
28000,Why not as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say Let us do evil that good may come Those who say so are justly condemned,1.0
28001,What then Are we better than they No in no way For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin,1.0
28002,As it is written There is no one righteous No not one,1.0
28004,They have all turned aside They have together become unprofitable There is no one who does good No not so much as one,1.0
28005,Their throat is an open tomb With their tongues they have used deceit  The poison of vipers is under their lips,1.0
28006,Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness,1.0
28007,Their feet are swift to shed blood,1.0
28008,Destruction and misery are in their ways,1.0
28010,There is no fear of God before their eyes,1.0
28014,even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe For there is no distinction,1.0
28015,for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,1.0
28016,being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,1.0
28018,to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time that he might himself be just and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus,1.0
28020,We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law,1.0
28021,Or is God the God of Jews only Isnt he the God of Gentiles also Yes of Gentiles also,1.0
28022,since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith,1.0
28023,Do we then nullify the law through faith May it never be! No we establish the law,1.0
28025,For if Abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about but not toward God,1.0
28026,For what does the Scripture say Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness,1.0
28030,Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven Whose sins are covered,1.0
28032,Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised or on the uncircumcised also For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness,1.0
28036,For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasnt through the law but through the righteousness of faith,1.0
28037,For if those who are of the law are heirs faith is made void and the promise is made of no effect,1.0
28038,For the law works wrath for where there is no law neither is there disobedience,1.0
28039,For this cause it is of faith that it may be according to grace to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all,1.0
28042,Without being weakened in faith he didnt consider his own body already having been worn out he being about a hundred years old and the deadness of Sarahs womb,1.0
28043,Yet looking to the promise of God he didnt waver through unbelief but grew strong through faith giving glory to God,1.0
28044,and being fully assured that what he had promised he was able also to perform,1.0
28045,Therefore it also was reckoned to him for righteousness,1.0
28046,Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,1.0
28047,but for our sake also to whom it will be accounted who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,1.0
28048,who was delivered up for our trespasses and was raised for our justification,1.0
28049,Being therefore justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
28051,Not only this but we also rejoice in our sufferings knowing that suffering works perseverance,1.0
28052,and perseverance proven character and proven character hope,1.0
28053,and hope doesnt disappoint us because Gods love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us,1.0
28054,For while we were yet weak at the right time Christ died for the ungodly,1.0
28057,Much more then being now justified by his blood we will be saved from Gods wrath through him,1.0
28058,For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son much more being reconciled we will be saved by his life,1.0
28059,Not only so but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received the reconciliation,1.0
28061,For until the law sin was in the world but sin is not charged when there is no law,1.0
28067,For as through the one mans disobedience many were made sinners even so through the obedience of the one will many be made righteous,1.0
28068,The law came in besides that the trespass might abound but where sin abounded grace did abound more exceedingly,1.0
28070,What shall we say then Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound,1.0
28072,Or dont you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death,1.0
28074,For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death we will also be part of his resurrection,1.0
28075,knowing this that our old man was crucified with him that the body of sin might be done away with so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin,1.0
28077,But if we died with Christ we believe that we will also live with him,1.0
28079,For the death that he died he died to sin one time but the life that he lives he lives to God,1.0
28081,Therefore dont let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in its lusts,1.0
28083,For sin will not have dominion over you For you are not under law but under grace,1.0
28084,What then Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace May it never be!,1.0
28086,But thanks be to God that whereas you were bondservants of sin you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered,1.0
28087,Being made free from sin you became bondservants of righteousness,1.0
28088,I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification,1.0
28090,What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed For the end of those things is death,1.0
28091,But now being made free from sin and having become servants of God you have your fruit of sanctification and the result of eternal life,1.0
28092,For the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord,1.0
28094,For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives but if the husband dies she is discharged from the law of the husband,1.0
28095,So then if while the husband lives she is joined to another man she would be called an adulteress But if the husband dies she is free from the law so that she is no adulteress though she is joined to another man,1.0
28097,For when we were in the flesh the sinful passions which were through the law worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death,1.0
28098,But now we have been discharged from the law having died to that in which we were held so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter,1.0
28100,But sin finding occasion through the commandment produced in me all kinds of coveting For apart from the law sin is dead,1.0
28101,I was alive apart from the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and I died,1.0
28102,The commandment which was for life this I found to be for death,1.0
28106,For we know that the law is spiritual but I am fleshly sold under sin,1.0
28108,But if what I dont desire that I do I consent to the law that it is good,1.0
28109,So now it is no more I that do it but sin which dwells in me,1.0
28110,For I know that in me that is in my flesh dwells no good thing For desire is present with me but I dont find it doing that which is good,1.0
28115,but I see a different law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members,1.0
28116,What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death,1.0
28117,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then with the mind I myself serve Gods law but with the flesh the sins law,1.0
28118,There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus who dont walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit,1.0
28119,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death,1.0
28121,that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit,1.0
28122,For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit,1.0
28123,For the mind of the flesh is death but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace,1.0
28124,because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God for it is not subject to Gods law neither indeed can it be,1.0
28128,But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you,1.0
28129,So then brothers we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh,1.0
28131,For as many as are led by the Spirit of God these are children of God,1.0
28133,The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,1.0
28134,and if children then heirs heirs of God and jointheirs with Christ if indeed we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him,1.0
28136,For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed,1.0
28138,that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God,1.0
28139,For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now,1.0
28144,He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirits mind because he makes intercession for the saints according to God,1.0
28147,Whom he predestined those he also called Whom he called those he also justified Whom he justified those he also glorified,1.0
28148,What then shall we say about these things If God is for us who can be against us,1.0
28149,He who didnt spare his own Son but delivered him up for us all how would he not also with him freely give us all things,1.0
28150,Who could bring a charge against Gods chosen ones It is God who justifies,1.0
28151,Who is he who condemns It is Christ who died yes rather who was raised from the dead who is at the right hand of God who also makes intercession for us,1.0
28154,No in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us,1.0
28157,I tell the truth in Christ I am not lying my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,1.0
28158,that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart,1.0
28159,For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers sake my relatives according to the flesh,1.0
28161,of whom are the fathers and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh who is over all God blessed forever Amen,1.0
28162,But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing For they are not all Israel that are of Israel,1.0
28168,it was said to her The elder will serve the younger,1.0
28169,Even as it is written Jacob I loved but Esau I hated,1.0
28171,For he said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion,1.0
28173,For the Scripture says to Pharaoh For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up that I might show in you my power and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth,1.0
28174,So then he has mercy on whom he desires and he hardens whom he desires,1.0
28176,But indeed O man who are you to reply against God Will the thing formed ask him who formed it Why did you make me like this,1.0
28177,Or hasnt the potter a right over the clay from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor and another for dishonor,1.0
28178,What if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,1.0
28179,and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy which he prepared beforehand for glory,1.0
28180,us whom he also called not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles,1.0
28181,As he says also in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people And her beloved who was not beloved,1.0
28182,It will be that in the place where it was said to them You are not my people There they will be called children of the living God,1.0
28184,For He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness Because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth,1.0
28185,As Isaiah has said before Unless the Lord of Hosts{Greek Sabaoth} had left us a seed We would have become like Sodom And would have been made like Gomorrah,1.0
28187,but Israel following after a law of righteousness didnt arrive at the law of righteousness,1.0
28188,Why Because they didnt seek it by faith but as it were by works of the law They stumbled over the stumbling stone,1.0
28189,even as it is written Behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense And no one who believes in him will be disappointed,1.0
28191,For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God but not according to knowledge,1.0
28192,For being ignorant of Gods righteousness and seeking to establish their own righteousness they didnt subject themselves to the righteousness of God,1.0
28193,For Christ is the fulfillment{or completion or end} of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes,1.0
28196,or Who will descend into the abyss that is to bring Christ up from the dead,1.0
28198,that if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved,1.0
28202,For Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved,1.0
28203,How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed How will they believe in him whom they have not heard How will they hear without a preacher,1.0
28205,But they didnt all listen to the glad news For Isaiah says Lord who has believed our report,1.0
28207,But I say didnt they hear Yes most assuredly Their sound went out into all the earth Their words to the ends of the world,1.0
28209,Isaiah is very bold and says I was found by those who didnt seek me I was revealed to those who didnt ask for me,1.0
28214,But how does God answer him I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal,1.0
28216,And if by grace then it is no longer of works otherwise grace is no longer grace But if it is of works it is no longer grace otherwise work is no longer work,1.0
28217,What then That which Israel seeks for that he didnt obtain but the chosen ones obtained it and the rest were hardened,1.0
28220,Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see Bow down their back always,1.0
28222,Now if their fall is the riches of the world and their loss the riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness,1.0
28223,For I speak to you who are Gentiles Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles I glorify my ministry,1.0
28224,if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and may save some of them,1.0
28226,If the first fruit is holy so is the lump If the root is holy so are the branches,1.0
28227,But if some of the branches were broken off and you being a wild olive were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree,1.0
28229,You will say then Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in,1.0
28231,for if God didnt spare the natural branches neither will he spare you,1.0
28232,See then the goodness and severity of God Toward those who fell severity but toward you goodness if you continue in his goodness otherwise you also will be cut off,1.0
28233,They also if they dont continue in their unbelief will be grafted in for God is able to graft them in again,1.0
28234,For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more will these which are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree,1.0
28235,For I dont desire brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} to have you ignorant of this mystery so that you wont be wise in your own conceits that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,1.0
28238,Concerning the Gospel they are enemies for your sake But concerning the election they are beloved for the fathers sake,1.0
28239,For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable,1.0
28242,For God has shut up all to disobedience that he might have mercy on all,1.0
28243,Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past tracing out!,1.0
28244,For who has known the mind of the Lord Or who has been his counselor,1.0
28245,Or who has first given to him And it will be repaid to him again,1.0
28246,For of him and through him and to him are all things To him be the glory for ever! Amen,1.0
28247,Therefore I urge you brothers by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to God which is your spiritual service,1.0
28248,Dont be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what is the good wellpleasing and perfect will of God,1.0
28249,For I say through the grace that was given me to every man who is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think reasonably as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith,1.0
28250,For even as we have many members in one body and all the members dont have the same function,1.0
28251,so we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members one of another,1.0
28254,or he who exhorts to his exhorting he who gives let him do it with liberality he who rules with diligence he who shows mercy with cheerfulness,1.0
28256,In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another in honor preferring one another,1.0
28257,not lagging in diligence fervent in spirit serving the Lord,1.0
28263,Repay no one evil for evil Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men,1.0
28264,If it is possible as much as it is up to you be at peace with all men,1.0
28265,Dont seek revenge yourselves beloved but give place to Gods wrath For it is written Vengeance belongs to me I will repay says the Lord,1.0
28266,Therefore If your enemy is hungry feed him If he is thirsty give him a drink For in doing so you will heap coals of fire on his head,1.0
28267,Dont be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good,1.0
28269,Therefore he who resists the authority withstands the ordinance of God and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment,1.0
28271,for he is a servant of God to you for good But if you do that which is evil be afraid for he doesnt bear the sword in vain for he is a minister of God an avenger for wrath to him who does evil,1.0
28272,Therefore you need to be in subjection not only because of the wrath but also for conscience sake,1.0
28273,For this reason you also pay taxes for they are ministers of Gods service attending continually on this very thing,1.0
28275,Owe no one anything except to love one another for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law,1.0
28277,Love doesnt harm a neighbor Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law,1.0
28278,Do this knowing the time that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed,1.0
28280,Let us walk properly as in the day not in reveling and drunkenness not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts and not in strife and jealousy,1.0
28281,But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh for its lusts,1.0
28282,Now receive one who is weak in faith but not for disputes over opinions,1.0
28283,One man has faith to eat all things but he who is weak eats only vegetables,1.0
28284,Dont let him who eats despise him who doesnt eat Dont let him who doesnt eat judge him who eats for God has received him,1.0
28285,Who are you who judge anothers servant To his own lord he stands or falls Yes he will be made to stand for God has power to make him stand,1.0
28286,One man esteems one day as more important Another esteems every day alike Let each man be fully assured in his own mind,1.0
28287,He who observes the day observes it to the Lord and he who does not observe the day to the Lord he does not observe it He who eats eats to the Lord for he gives God thanks He who doesnt eat to the Lord he doesnt eat and gives God thanks,1.0
28288,For none of us lives to himself and none dies to himself,1.0
28289,For if we live we live to the Lord Or if we die we die to the Lord If therefore we live or die we are the Lords,1.0
28290,For to this end Christ died rose and lived again that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living,1.0
28291,But you why do you judge your brother Or you again why do you despise your brother For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ,1.0
28292,For it is written As I live says the Lord to me every knee will bow Every tongue will confess to God,1.0
28293,So then each one of us will give account of himself to God,1.0
28296,Yet if because of food your brother is grieved you walk no longer in love Dont destroy with your food him for whom Christ died,1.0
28298,for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,1.0
28299,For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men,1.0
28300,So then let us follow after things which make for peace and things by which we may build one another up,1.0
28301,Dont overthrow Gods work for foods sake All things indeed are clean however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating,1.0
28302,It is good to not eat meat drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles is offended or is made weak,1.0
28303,Do you have faith Have it to yourself before God Happy is he who doesnt judge himself in that which he approves,1.0
28304,But he who doubts is condemned if he eats because it isnt of faith and whatever is not of faith is sin 1424 Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages 1425 but now is revealed and by the Scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the eternal God is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations 1426 to the only wise God through Jesus Christ to whom be the glory forever! Amen{TR places verses 2426 after Romans 1624 as verses 2527},1.0
28305,Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak and not to please ourselves,1.0
28306,Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good to be building him up,1.0
28308,For whatever things were written before were written for our learning that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope,1.0
28313,and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy As it is written Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles And sing to your name,1.0
28314,Again he says Rejoice you Gentiles with his people,1.0
28316,Again Isaiah says There will be the root of Jesse He who arises to rule over the Gentiles On him will the Gentiles hope,1.0
28317,Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit,1.0
28318,I myself am also persuaded about you my brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} that you yourselves are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish others,1.0
28319,But I write the more boldly to you in part as reminding you because of the grace that was given to me by God,1.0
28320,that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles ministering as a priest the Gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable sanctified by the Holy Spirit,1.0
28323,in the power of signs and wonders in the power of Gods Spirit so that from Jerusalem and around as far as to Illyricum I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ,1.0
28327,but now no longer having any place in these regions and having these many years a longing to come to you,1.0
28328,whenever I journey to Spain I will come to you For I hope to see you on my journey and to be helped on my way there by you if first I may enjoy your company for a while,1.0
28329,But now I say I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints,1.0
28330,For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem,1.0
28331,Yes it has been their good pleasure and they are their debtors For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things,1.0
28333,I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ,1.0
28335,that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,1.0
28336,that I may come to you in joy through the will of God and together with you find rest,1.0
28337,Now the God of peace be with you all Amen,1.0
28339,that you receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you for she herself also has been a helper of many and of my own self,1.0
28340,Greet Prisca and Aquila my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,1.0
28342,Greet the assembly that is in their house Greet Epaenetus my beloved who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ,1.0
28343,Greet Mary who labored much for us,1.0
28344,Greet Andronicus and Junias my relatives and my fellow prisoners who are notable among the apostles who also were in Christ before me,1.0
28345,Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord,1.0
28347,Greet Apelles the approved in Christ Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus,1.0
28348,Greet Herodion my kinsman Greet them of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord,1.0
28350,Greet Rufus the chosen in the Lord and his mother and mine,1.0
28351,Greet Asyncritus Phlegon Hermes Patrobas Hermas and the brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} who are with them,1.0
28352,Greet Philologus and Julia Nereus and his sister and Olympas and all the saints who are with them,1.0
28353,Greet one another with a holy kiss The assemblies of Christ greet you,1.0
28354,Now I beg you brothers look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling contrary to the doctrine which you learned and turn away from them,1.0
28356,For your obedience has become known to all I rejoice therefore over you But I desire to have you wise in that which is good but innocent in that which is evil,1.0
28358,Timothy my fellow worker greets you as do Lucius Jason and Sosipater my relatives,1.0
28359,I Tertius who write the letter greet you in the Lord,1.0
28360,Gaius my host and host of the whole assembly greets you Erastus the treasurer of the city greets you as does Quartus the brother,1.0
28362,{See Romans 1423},1.0
28363,{See Romans 1423},1.0
28364,{See Romans 1423} {TR places Romans 142426 at the end of Romans instead of at the end of chapter 14 and numbers these verses 162527},1.0
28366,to the assembly of God which is at Corinth those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be saints with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place both theirs and ours,1.0
28367,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
28368,I always thank my God concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,1.0
28370,even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,1.0
28371,so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
28372,who will also confirm you until the end blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
28373,God is faithful through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord,1.0
28375,For it has been reported to me concerning you my brothers by those who are from Chloes household that there are contentions among you,1.0
28376,Now I mean this that each one of you says I follow Paul I follow Apollos I follow Cephas and I follow Christ,1.0
28377,Is Christ divided Was Paul crucified for you Or were you baptized into the name of Paul,1.0
28378,I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,1.0
28379,so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name,1.0
28380,I also baptized the household of Stephanas besides them I dont know whether I baptized any other,1.0
28381,For Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the Gospelnot in wisdom of words so that the cross of Christ wouldnt be made void,1.0
28383,For it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing,1.0
28384,Where is the wise Where is the scribe Where is the lawyer of this world Hasnt God made foolish the wisdom of this world,1.0
28385,For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom didnt know God it was Gods good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe,1.0
28386,For Jews ask for signs Greeks seek after wisdom,1.0
28387,but we preach Christ crucified a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks,1.0
28390,For you see your calling brothers that not many are wise according to the flesh not many mighty and not many noble,1.0
28393,that no flesh should boast before God,1.0
28395,that according as it is written He who boasts let him boast in the Lord,1.0
28398,I was with you in weakness in fear and in much trembling,1.0
28399,My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,1.0
28400,that your faith wouldnt stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God,1.0
28406,For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him Even so no one knows the things of God except Gods Spirit,1.0
28408,Which things also we speak not in words which mans wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual things,1.0
28412,Brothers I couldnt speak to you as to spiritual but as to fleshly as to babies in Christ,1.0
28413,I fed you with milk not with meat for you werent yet ready Indeed not even now are you ready,1.0
28414,for you are still fleshly For insofar as there is jealousy strife and factions among you arent you fleshly and dont you walk in the ways of men,1.0
28415,For when one says I follow Paul and another I follow Apollos arent you fleshly,1.0
28417,I planted Apollos watered But God gave the increase,1.0
28420,For we are Gods fellow workers You are Gods farming Gods building,1.0
28421,According to the grace of God which was given to me as a wise master builder I laid a foundation and another builds on it But let each man be careful how he builds on it,1.0
28424,each mans work will be revealed For the Day will declare it because it is revealed in fire and the fire itself will test what sort of work each mans work is,1.0
28426,If any mans work is burned he will suffer loss but he himself will be saved but as through fire,1.0
28427,Dont you know that you are a temple of God and that Gods Spirit lives in you,1.0
28428,If anyone destroys the temple of God God will destroy him for Gods temple is holy which you are,1.0
28430,For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God For it is written He has taken the wise in their craftiness,1.0
28431,And again The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise that it is worthless,1.0
28432,Therefore let no one boast in men For all things are yours,1.0
28433,whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come All are yours,1.0
28435,So let a man think of us as Christs servants and stewards of Gods mysteries,1.0
28437,But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by mans judgment Yes I dont judge my own self,1.0
28438,For I know nothing against myself Yet I am not justified by this but he who judges me is the Lord,1.0
28439,Therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts Then each man will get his praise from God,1.0
28440,Now these things brothers I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written that none of you be puffed up against one another,1.0
28443,For I think that God has displayed us the apostles last of all like men sentenced to death For we are made a spectacle to the world both to angels and men,1.0
28444,We are fools for Christs sake but you are wise in Christ We are weak but you are strong You have honor but we have dishonor,1.0
28446,We toil working with our own hands When people curse us we bless Being persecuted we endure,1.0
28448,I dont write these things to shame you but to admonish you as my beloved children,1.0
28450,I beg you therefore be imitators of me,1.0
28452,Now some are puffed up as though I were not coming to you,1.0
28453,But I will come to you shortly if the Lord is willing And I will know not the word of those who are puffed up but the power,1.0
28454,For the Kingdom of God is not in word but in power,1.0
28455,What do you want Shall I come to you with a rod or in love and a spirit of gentleness,1.0
28457,You are puffed up and didnt rather mourn that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you,1.0
28460,are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,1.0
28461,Your boasting is not good Dont you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump,1.0
28463,Therefore let us keep the feast not with old yeast neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,1.0
28464,I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners,1.0
28465,yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world or with the covetous and extortioners or with idolaters for then you would have to leave the world,1.0
28466,But as it is I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner or covetous or an idolater or a slanderer or a drunkard or an extortioner Dont even eat with such a person,1.0
28467,For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside Dont you judge those who are within,1.0
28468,But those who are outside God judges Put away the wicked man from among yourselves,1.0
28470,Dont you know that the saints will judge the world And if the world is judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters,1.0
28474,But brother goes to law with brother and that before unbelievers!,1.0
28475,Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you that you have lawsuits one with another Why not rather be wronged Why not rather be defrauded,1.0
28477,Or dont you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God Dont be deceived Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexuals,1.0
28478,nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor slanderers nor extortioners will inherit the Kingdom of God,1.0
28479,Such were some of you but you were washed But you were sanctified But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God,1.0
28480,All things are lawful for me but not all things are expedient All things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of anything,1.0
28481,Foods for the belly and the belly for foods but God will bring to nothing both it and them But the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord and the Lord for the body,1.0
28482,Now God raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by his power,1.0
28483,Dont you know that your bodies are members of Christ Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute May it never be!,1.0
28484,Or dont you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body For The two says he will become one flesh,1.0
28485,But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit,1.0
28487,Or dont you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you which you have from God You are not your own,1.0
28490,But because of sexual immoralities let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband,1.0
28491,Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her and likewise also the wife to her husband,1.0
28493,Dont deprive one another unless it is by consent for a season that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and may be together again that Satan doesnt tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol,1.0
28494,But this I say by way of concession not of commandment,1.0
28495,Yet I wish that all men were like me However each man has his own gift from God one of this kind and another of that kind,1.0
28496,But I say to the unmarried and to widows it is good for them if they remain even as I am,1.0
28497,But if they dont have selfcontrol let them marry For its better to marry than to burn,1.0
28500,But to the rest Inot the Lordsay if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is content to live with him let him not leave her,1.0
28501,The woman who has an unbelieving husband and he is content to live with her let her not leave her husband,1.0
28502,For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband Otherwise your children would be unclean but now are they holy,1.0
28503,Yet if the unbeliever departs let there be separation The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases but God has called us in peace,1.0
28504,For how do you know wife whether you will save your husband Or how do you know husband whether you will save your wife,1.0
28507,Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of God,1.0
28508,Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called,1.0
28509,Were you called being a bondservant Dont let that bother you but if you get an opportunity to become free use it,1.0
28513,Now concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy,1.0
28515,Are you bound to a wife Dont seek to be freed Are you free from a wife Dont seek a wife,1.0
28516,But if you marry you have not sinned If a virgin marries she has not sinned Yet such will have oppression in the flesh and I want to spare you,1.0
28517,But I say this brothers the time is short that from now on both those who have wives may be as though they had none,1.0
28518,and those who weep as though they didnt weep and those who rejoice as though they didnt rejoice and those who buy as though they didnt possess,1.0
28519,and those who use the world as not using it to the fullest For the mode of this world passes away,1.0
28520,But I desire to have you to be free from cares He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord how he may please the Lord,1.0
28523,This I say for your own profit not that I may ensnare you but for that which is appropriate and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction,1.0
28524,But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin if she is past the flower of her age and if need so requires let him do what he desires He doesnt sin Let them marry,1.0
28526,So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well and he who doesnt give her in marriage does better,1.0
28528,But she is happier if she stays as she is in my judgment and I think that I also have Gods Spirit,1.0
28531,But if anyone loves God the same is known by him,1.0
28533,For though there are things that are called gods whether in the heavens or on earth as there are many gods and many lords,1.0
28534,yet to us there is one God the Father of whom are all things and we for him and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things and we live through him,1.0
28535,However that knowledge isnt in all men But some with consciousness of the idol until now eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled,1.0
28537,But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak,1.0
28538,For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idols temple wont his conscience if he is weak be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols,1.0
28539,And through your knowledge he who is weak perishes the brother for whose sake Christ died,1.0
28540,Thus sinning against the brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak you sin against Christ,1.0
28541,Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble I will eat no meat forevermore that I dont cause my brother to stumble,1.0
28542,Am I not free Am I not an apostle Havent I seen Jesus Christ our Lord Arent you my work in the Lord,1.0
28543,If to others I am not an apostle yet at least I am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord,1.0
28544,My defense to those who examine me is this,1.0
28545,Have we no right to eat and to drink,1.0
28546,Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas,1.0
28547,Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work,1.0
28549,Do I speak these things according to the ways of men Or doesnt the law also say the same thing,1.0
28551,or does he say it assuredly for our sake Yes it was written for our sake because he who plows ought to plow in hope and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope,1.0
28553,If others partake of this right over you dont we yet more Nevertheless we did not use this right but we bear all things that we may cause no hindrance to the Gospel of Christ,1.0
28554,Dont you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar,1.0
28555,Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Gospel should live from the Gospel,1.0
28558,For if I do this of my own will I have a reward But if not of my own will I have a stewardship entrusted to me,1.0
28560,For though I was free from all I brought myself under bondage to all that I might gain the more,1.0
28564,Now I do this for the Gospels sake that I may be a joint partaker of it,1.0
28566,Every man who strives in the games exercises selfcontrol in all things Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible,1.0
28567,I therefore run like that as not uncertainly I fight like that as not beating the air,1.0
28568,but I beat my body and bring it into submission lest by any means after I have preached to others I myself should be rejected,1.0
28569,Now I would not have you ignorant brothers that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea,1.0
28570,and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,1.0
28571,and all ate the same spiritual food,1.0
28573,However with most of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness,1.0
28574,Now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted,1.0
28575,Neither be idolaters as some of them were As it is written The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play,1.0
28576,Neither let us commit sexual immorality as some of them committed and in one day twentythree thousand fell,1.0
28580,Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesnt fall,1.0
28581,No temptation has taken you except what is common to man God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able but will with the temptation also make the way of escape that you may be able to endure it,1.0
28583,I speak as to wise men Judge what I say,1.0
28584,The cup of blessing which we bless isnt it a communion of the blood of Christ The bread which we break isnt it a communion of the body of Christ,1.0
28586,Consider Israel after the flesh Dont those who eat the sacrifices have communion with the altar,1.0
28587,What am I saying then That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything,1.0
28590,Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy Are we stronger than he,1.0
28591,All things are lawful for me but not all things are profitable All things are lawful for me but not all things build up,1.0
28596,But if anyone says to you This was offered to idols dont eat it for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience For the earth is the Lords and all its fullness,1.0
28597,Conscience I say not your own but the others conscience For why is my liberty judged by another conscience,1.0
28600,Give no occasions for stumbling either to Jews or to Greeks or to the assembly of God,1.0
28602,Be imitators of me even as I also am of Christ,1.0
28606,But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved,1.0
28607,For if a woman is not covered let her also be shorn But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved let her be covered,1.0
28609,For man is not from woman but woman from man,1.0
28610,for neither was man created for the woman but woman for the man,1.0
28611,For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head because of the angels,1.0
28612,Nevertheless neither is the woman independent of the man nor the man independent of the woman in the Lord,1.0
28613,For as woman came from man so a man also comes through a woman but all things are from God,1.0
28615,Doesnt even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a dishonor to him,1.0
28616,But if a woman has long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given to her for a covering,1.0
28617,But if any man seems to be contentious we have no such custom neither do Gods assemblies,1.0
28619,For first of all when you come together in the assembly I hear that divisions exist among you and I partly believe it,1.0
28620,For there also must be factions among you that those who are approved may be revealed among you,1.0
28621,When therefore you assemble yourselves together it is not possible to eat the Lords supper,1.0
28622,For in your eating each one takes his own supper before others One is hungry and another is drunken,1.0
28623,What dont you have houses to eat and to drink in Or do you despise Gods assembly and put them to shame who dont have What shall I tell you Shall I praise you In this I dont praise you,1.0
28626,In the same way he also took the cup after supper saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood Do this as often as you drink in memory of me,1.0
28627,For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lords death until he comes,1.0
28629,But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup,1.0
28630,For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself if he doesnt discern the Lords body,1.0
28632,For if we discerned ourselves we wouldnt be judged,1.0
28633,But when we are judged we are punished by the Lord that we may not be condemned with the world,1.0
28635,But if anyone is hungry let him eat at home lest your coming together be for judgment The rest I will set in order whenever I come,1.0
28636,Now concerning spiritual things brothers I dont want you to be ignorant,1.0
28639,Now there are various kinds of gifts but the same Spirit,1.0
28643,For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,1.0
28644,to another faith by the same Spirit and to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,1.0
28645,and to another workings of miracles and to another prophecy and to another discerning of spirits to another different kinds of languages and to another the interpretation of languages,1.0
28646,But the one and the same Spirit works all of these distributing to each one separately as he desires,1.0
28647,For as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the body being many are one body so also is Christ,1.0
28648,For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body whether Jews or Greeks whether bond or free and were all given to drink into one Spirit,1.0
28651,If the ear would say Because Im not the eye Im not part of the body its not therefore not part of the body,1.0
28653,But now God has set the members each one of them in the body just as he desired,1.0
28655,But now they are many members but one body,1.0
28658,Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable on those we bestow more abundant honor and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety,1.0
28660,that there should be no division in the body but that the members should have the same care for one another,1.0
28662,Now you are the body of Christ and members individually,1.0
28663,God has set some in the assembly first apostles second prophets third teachers then miracle workers then gifts of healings helps governments and various kinds of languages,1.0
28664,Are all apostles Are all prophets Are all teachers Are all miracle workers,1.0
28665,Do all have gifts of healings Do all speak with various languages Do all interpret,1.0
28666,But earnestly desire the best gifts Moreover I show a most excellent way to you,1.0
28669,If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor and if I give my body to be burned but dont have love it profits me nothing,1.0
28670,Love is patient and is kind love doesnt envy Love doesnt brag is not proud,1.0
28671,doesnt behave itself inappropriately doesnt seek its own way is not provoked takes no account of evil,1.0
28672,doesnt rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth,1.0
28673,bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things,1.0
28675,For we know in part and we prophesy in part,1.0
28676,but when that which is complete has come then that which is partial will be done away with,1.0
28678,For now we see in a mirror dimly but then face to face Now I know in part but then I will know fully even as I was also fully known,1.0
28679,But now faith hope and love remainthese three The greatest of these is love,1.0
28681,For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men but to God for no one understands but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries,1.0
28683,He who speaks in another language edifies himself but he who prophesies edifies the assembly,1.0
28684,Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages but rather that you would prophesy For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages unless he interprets that the assembly may be built up,1.0
28685,But now brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} if I come to you speaking with other languages what would I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophesying or of teaching,1.0
28686,Even things without life giving a voice whether pipe or harp if they didnt give a distinction in the sounds how would it be known what is piped or harped,1.0
28687,For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound who would prepare himself for war,1.0
28688,So also you unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand how would it be known what is spoken For you would be speaking into the air,1.0
28689,There are it may be so many kinds of sounds in the world and none of them is without meaning,1.0
28690,If then I dont know the meaning of the sound I would be to him who speaks a foreigner and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me,1.0
28691,So also you since you are zealous for spiritual gifts seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly,1.0
28692,Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret,1.0
28694,What is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also,1.0
28696,For you most assuredly give thanks well but the other person is not built up,1.0
28697,I thank my God I speak with other languages more than you all,1.0
28698,However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding that I might instruct others also than ten thousand words in another language,1.0
28699,Brothers dont be children in thoughts yet in malice be babies but in thoughts be mature,1.0
28700,In the law it is written By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people Not even thus will they hear me says the Lord,1.0
28701,Therefore other languages are for a sign not to those who believe but to the unbelieving but prophesying is for a sign not to the unbelieving but to those who believe,1.0
28702,If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages and unlearned or unbelieving people come in wont they say that you are crazy,1.0
28705,What is it then brothers When you come together each one of you has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has another language has an interpretation Let all things be done to build each other up,1.0
28707,But if there is no interpreter let him keep silent in the assembly and let him speak to himself and to God,1.0
28708,Let the prophets speak two or three and let the others discern,1.0
28709,But if a revelation is made to another sitting by let the first keep silent,1.0
28710,For you all can prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be exhorted,1.0
28711,The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,1.0
28712,for God is not a God of confusion but of peace As in all the assemblies of the saints,1.0
28713,let your wives keep silent in the assemblies for it has not been permitted for them to speak but let them be in subjection as the law also says,1.0
28714,If they desire to learn anything let them ask their own husbands at home for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly,1.0
28715,What Was it from you that the word of God went out Or did it come to you alone,1.0
28716,If any man thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him recognize the things which I write to you that they are the commandment of the Lord,1.0
28718,Therefore brothers desire earnestly to prophesy and dont forbid speaking with other languages,1.0
28719,Let all things be done decently and in order,1.0
28721,by which also you are saved if you hold firmly the word which I preached to youunless you believed in vain,1.0
28722,For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,1.0
28723,that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,1.0
28724,and that he appeared to Cephas then to the twelve,1.0
28726,Then he appeared to James then to all the apostles,1.0
28727,and last of all as to the child born at the wrong time he appeared to me also,1.0
28731,Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead,1.0
28732,But if there is no resurrection of the dead neither has Christ been raised,1.0
28734,Yes we are found false witnesses of God because we testified about God that he raised up Christ whom he didnt raise up if it is so that the dead are not raised,1.0
28735,For if the dead arent raised neither has Christ been raised,1.0
28737,Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished,1.0
28738,If we have only hoped in Christ in this life we are of all men most pitiable,1.0
28739,But now Christ has been raised from the dead He became the first fruits of those who are asleep,1.0
28740,For since death came by man the resurrection of the dead also came by man,1.0
28741,For as in Adam all die so also in Christ all will be made alive,1.0
28743,Then the end comes when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God even the Father when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power,1.0
28744,For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet,1.0
28747,When all things have been subjected to him then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him that God may be all in all,1.0
28748,Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead If the dead arent raised at all why then are they baptized for the dead,1.0
28749,Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour,1.0
28750,I affirm by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die daily,1.0
28751,If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes what does it profit me If the dead are not raised then let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die,1.0
28753,Wake up righteously and dont sin for some have no knowledge of God I say this to your shame,1.0
28754,But someone will say How are the dead raised and With what kind of body do they come,1.0
28755,You foolish one that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies,1.0
28756,That which you sow you dont sow the body that will be but a bare grain maybe of wheat or of some other kind,1.0
28757,But God gives it a body even as it pleased him and to each seed a body of its own,1.0
28758,All flesh is not the same flesh but there is one flesh of men another flesh of animals another of fish and another of birds,1.0
28759,There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial,1.0
28760,There is one glory of the sun another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differs from another star in glory,1.0
28762,It is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory It is sown in weakness it is raised in power,1.0
28763,It is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body,1.0
28765,However that which is spiritual isnt first but that which is natural then that which is spiritual,1.0
28767,As is the one made of dust such are those who are also made of dust and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly,1.0
28768,As we have borne the image of those made of dust lets{NU TR read we will instead of lets} also bear the image of the heavenly,1.0
28770,Behold I tell you a mystery We will not all sleep but we will all be changed,1.0
28771,in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible and we will be changed,1.0
28775,The sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law,1.0
28777,Therefore my beloved brothers be steadfast immovable always abounding in the Lords work because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord,1.0
28778,Now concerning the collection for the saints as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia you do likewise,1.0
28779,On the first day of the week let each one of you save as he may prosper that no collections be made when I come,1.0
28780,When I arrive I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem,1.0
28781,If it is appropriate for me to go also they will go with me,1.0
28782,But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia for I am passing through Macedonia,1.0
28783,But with you it may be that I will stay or even winter that you may send me on my journey wherever I go,1.0
28784,For I do not wish to see you now in passing but I hope to stay a while with you if the Lord permits,1.0
28785,But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,1.0
28789,Now concerning Apollos the brother I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers and it was not at all his desire to come now but he will come when he has an opportunity,1.0
28790,Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!,1.0
28791,Let all that you do be done in love,1.0
28795,For they refreshed my spirit and yours Therefore acknowledge those who are like that,1.0
28799,If any man doesnt love the Lord Jesus Christ let him be accursed{Greek anathema} Come Lord!{Aramaic Maranatha!},1.0
28800,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you,1.0
28801,My love to all of you in Christ Jesus Amen,1.0
28802,Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God and Timothy our brother to the assembly of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia,1.0
28803,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
28804,Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,1.0
28805,who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God,1.0
28806,For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us even so our comfort also abounds through Christ,1.0
28807,But if we are afflicted it is for your comfort and salvation If we are comforted it is for your comfort which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer,1.0
28809,For we dont desire to have you uninformed brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia that we were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power so much that we despaired even of life,1.0
28810,Yes we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,1.0
28812,you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication that for the gift bestowed on us by means of many thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf,1.0
28813,For our boasting is this the testimony of our conscience that in holiness and sincerity of God not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world and more abundantly toward you,1.0
28815,as also you acknowledged us in part that we are your boasting even as you also are ours in the day of our Lord Jesus,1.0
28818,When I therefore was thus determined did I show fickleness Or the things that I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be the Yes yes and the No no,1.0
28820,For the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us by me Silvanus and Timothy was not Yes and no but in him is Yes,1.0
28822,Now he who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,1.0
28824,But I call God for a witness to my soul that I didnt come to Corinth to spare you,1.0
28825,Not that we have lordship over your faith but are fellow workers with you for your joy For you stand firm in faith,1.0
28826,But I determined this for myself that I would not come to you again in sorrow,1.0
28827,For if I make you sorry then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me,1.0
28828,And I wrote this very thing to you so that when I came I wouldnt have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy would be shared by all of you,1.0
28829,For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears not that you should be made sorry but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you,1.0
28830,But if any has caused sorrow he has caused sorrow not to me but in part that I not press too heavily to you all,1.0
28831,Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many,1.0
28833,Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him,1.0
28834,For to this end I also wrote that I might know the proof of you whether you are obedient in all things,1.0
28835,Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything For if indeed I have forgiven anything I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,1.0
28836,that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan for we are not ignorant of his schemes,1.0
28837,Now when I came to Troas for the Gospel of Christ and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,1.0
28838,I had no relief for my spirit because I didnt find Titus my brother but taking my leave of them I went out into Macedonia,1.0
28839,Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place,1.0
28841,to the one a stench from death to death to the other a sweet aroma from life to life Who is sufficient for these things,1.0
28842,For we are not as so many peddling the word of God But as of sincerity but as of God in the sight of God we speak in Christ,1.0
28844,You are our letter written in our hearts known and read by all men,1.0
28845,being revealed that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God not in tablets of stone but in tablets that are hearts of flesh,1.0
28846,Such confidence we have through Christ toward God,1.0
28847,not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves but our sufficiency is from God,1.0
28849,But if the service of death written engraved on stones came with glory so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face which was passing away,1.0
28850,wont service of the Spirit be with much more glory,1.0
28851,For if the service of condemnation has glory the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory,1.0
28854,Having therefore such a hope we use great boldness of speech,1.0
28856,But their minds were hardened for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains because in Christ it passes away,1.0
28857,But to this day when Moses is read a veil lies on their heart,1.0
28858,But whenever one turns to the Lord the veil is taken away,1.0
28859,Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty,1.0
28862,But we have renounced the hidden things of shame not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of God,1.0
28865,For we dont preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord and ourselves as your servants for Jesus sake,1.0
28866,seeing it is God who said Light will shine out of darkness who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,1.0
28867,But we have this treasure in clay vessels that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God and not from ourselves,1.0
28868,We are pressed on every side yet not crushed perplexed yet not to despair,1.0
28871,For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh,1.0
28873,But having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written I believed and therefore I spoke We also believe and therefore also we speak,1.0
28874,knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you,1.0
28875,For all things are for your sakes that the grace being multiplied through the many may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God,1.0
28876,Therefore we dont faint but though our outward man is decaying yet our inward man is renewed day by day,1.0
28878,while we dont look at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen For the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal,1.0
28882,For indeed we who are in this tent do groan being burdened not that we desire to be unclothed but that we desire to be clothed that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life,1.0
28886,We are of good courage I say and are willing rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord,1.0
28889,Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord we persuade men but we are revealed to God and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences,1.0
28890,For we are not commending ourselves to you again but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance and not in heart,1.0
28891,For if we are beside ourselves it is for God Or if we are of sober mind it is for you,1.0
28892,For the love of Christ constrains us because we judge thus that one died for all therefore all died,1.0
28894,Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on Even though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now we know him so no more,1.0
28895,Therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation The old things have passed away Behold all things have become new,1.0
28896,But all things are of God who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation,1.0
28897,namely that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not reckoning to them their trespasses and having committed to us the word of reconciliation,1.0
28900,Working together we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,1.0
28903,but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God in great endurance in afflictions in hardships in distresses,1.0
28904,in beatings in imprisonments in riots in labors in watchings in fastings,1.0
28906,in the word of truth in the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,1.0
28907,by glory and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true,1.0
28908,as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as punished and not killed,1.0
28911,You are not restricted by us but you are restricted by your own affections,1.0
28912,Now in return I speak as to my children you also be open wide,1.0
28918,Having therefore these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God,1.0
28919,Open your hearts to us We wronged no one We corrupted no one We took advantage of no one,1.0
28920,I say this not to condemn you for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and live together,1.0
28921,Great is my boldness of speech toward you Great is my boasting on your behalf I am filled with comfort I overflow with joy in all our affliction,1.0
28923,Nevertheless he who comforts the lowly God comforted us by the coming of Titus,1.0
28924,and not by his coming only but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you while he told us of your longing your mourning and your zeal for me so that I rejoiced still more,1.0
28925,For though I made you sorry with my letter I do not regret it though I did regret it For I see that my letter made you sorry though just for a while,1.0
28926,I now rejoice not that you were made sorry but that you were made sorry to repentance For you were made sorry in a godly way that you might suffer loss by us in nothing,1.0
28927,For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation which brings no regret But the sorrow of the world works death,1.0
28928,For behold this same thing that you were made sorry in a godly way what earnest care it worked in you Yes what defense indignation fear longing zeal and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter,1.0
28930,Therefore we have been comforted In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all,1.0
28936,For according to their power I testify yes and beyond their power they gave of their own accord,1.0
28937,begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints,1.0
28938,This was not as we had hoped but first they gave their own selves to the Lord and to us through the will of God,1.0
28939,So we urged Titus that as he made a beginning before so he would also complete in you this grace,1.0
28942,For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that you through his poverty might become rich,1.0
28943,I give a judgment in this for this is expedient for you who were the first to start a year ago not only to do but also to be willing,1.0
28945,For if the readiness is there it is acceptable according to what you have not according to what you dont have,1.0
28946,For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,1.0
28947,but for equality Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack that there may be equality,1.0
28948,As it is written He who gathered much had nothing left over and he who gathered little had no lack,1.0
28949,But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus,1.0
28950,For he indeed accepted our exhortation but being himself very earnest he went out to you of his own accord,1.0
28951,We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Gospel is known through all the assemblies,1.0
28953,We are avoiding this that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us,1.0
28954,Having regard for honorable things not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men,1.0
28955,We have sent with them our brother whom we have many times proved earnest in many things but now much more earnest by reason of the great confidence which he has in you,1.0
28956,As for Titus he is my partner and fellow worker for you As for our brothers they are the apostles of the assemblies the glory of Christ,1.0
28957,Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies and of our boasting on your behalf,1.0
28961,so that I wont by any means if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared we to say nothing of you should be disappointed in this confident boasting,1.0
28962,I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity and not of greediness,1.0
28963,Remember this he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully,1.0
28968,you being enriched in everything to all liberality which works through us thanksgiving to God,1.0
28969,For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God,1.0
28970,seeing that through the proof given by this service they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all,1.0
28973,Now I Paul myself entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ I who in your presence am lowly among you but being absent am of good courage toward you,1.0
28974,Yes I beg you that I may not when present show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some who consider us to be walking according to the flesh,1.0
28975,For though we walk in the flesh we dont wage war according to the flesh,1.0
28976,for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,1.0
28978,and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience will be made full,1.0
28979,Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christs let him consider this again with himself that even as he is Christs so also we are Christs,1.0
28981,that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters,1.0
28982,For His letters they say are weighty and strong but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is despised,1.0
28983,Let such a person consider this that what we are in word by letters when we are absent such are we also in deed when we are present,1.0
28984,For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves But they themselves measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves are without understanding,1.0
28988,so as to preach the Gospel even to the parts beyond you not to boast in what someone else has already done,1.0
28990,For it isnt he who commends himself who is approved but whom the Lord commends,1.0
28991,I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness but indeed you do bear with me,1.0
28992,For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy For I married you to one husband that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ,1.0
28993,But I am afraid that somehow as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ,1.0
28994,For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we did not preach or if you receive a different spirit which you did not receive or a different gospel which you did not accept you put up with that well enough,1.0
28995,For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles,1.0
28996,But though I am unskilled in speech yet I am not unskilled in knowledge No in every way we have been revealed to you in all things,1.0
28998,I robbed other assemblies taking wages from them that I might serve you,1.0
28999,When I was present with you and was in need I wasnt a burden on anyone for the brothers when they came from Macedonia supplied the measure of my need In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you and I will continue to do so,1.0
29004,And no wonder for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light,1.0
29007,That which I speak I dont speak according to the Lord but as in foolishness in this confidence of boasting,1.0
29008,Seeing that many boast after the flesh I will also boast,1.0
29010,For you bear with a man if he brings you into bondage if he devours you if he takes you captive if he exalts himself if he strikes you on the face,1.0
29011,I speak by way of disparagement as though we had been weak Yet however any is bold I speak in foolishness I am bold also,1.0
29012,Are they Hebrews So am I Are they Israelites So am I Are they the seed of Abraham So am I,1.0
29013,Are they servants of Christ I speak as one beside himself I am more so in labors more abundantly in prisons more abundantly in stripes above measure in deaths often,1.0
29017,in labor and travail in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often and in cold and nakedness,1.0
29018,Besides those things that are outside there is that which presses on me daily anxiety for all the assemblies,1.0
29020,If I must boast I will boast of the things that concern my weakness,1.0
29021,The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ he who is blessed forevermore knows that I dont lie,1.0
29024,It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord,1.0
29025,I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago whether in the body I dont know or whether out of the body I dont know God knows such a one caught up into the third heaven,1.0
29026,I know such a man whether in the body or outside of the body I dont know God knows,1.0
29027,how he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,1.0
29028,On behalf of such a one I will boast but on my own behalf I will not boast except in my weaknesses,1.0
29033,Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses in injuries in necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christs sake For when I am weak then am I strong,1.0
29034,I have become foolish in boasting You compelled me for I ought to have been commended by you for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles though I am nothing,1.0
29035,Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty works,1.0
29036,For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you Forgive me this wrong,1.0
29037,Behold this is the third time I am ready to come to you and I will not be a burden to you for I seek not your possessions but you For the children ought not to save up for the parents but the parents for the children,1.0
29038,I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls If I love you more abundantly am I loved the less,1.0
29040,Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you,1.0
29041,I exhorted Titus and I sent the brother with him Did Titus take any advantage of you Didnt we walk in the same spirit Didnt we walk in the same steps,1.0
29043,For I am afraid that by any means when I come I might find you not the way I want to and that I might be found by you as you dont desire that by any means there would be strife jealousy outbursts of anger factions slander whisperings proud thoughts riots,1.0
29046,I have said beforehand and I do say beforehand as when I was present the second time so now being absent I write to those who have sinned before now and to all the rest that if I come again I will not spare,1.0
29047,seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me who toward you is not weak but is powerful in you,1.0
29049,Test your own selves whether you are in the faith Test your own selves Or dont you know as to your own selves that Jesus Christ is in youunless indeed you are disqualified,1.0
29050,But I hope that you will know that we arent disqualified,1.0
29051,Now I pray to God that you do no evil not that we may appear approved but that you may do that which is honorable though we are as reprobate,1.0
29052,For we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth,1.0
29053,For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong And this we also pray for even your perfecting,1.0
29054,For this cause I write these things while absent that I may not deal sharply when present according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down,1.0
29055,Finally brothers rejoice Be perfected be comforted be of the same mind live in peace and the God of love and peace will be with you,1.0
29058,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all Amen,1.0
29059,Paul an apostle not from men neither through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead,1.0
29060,and all the brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} who are with me to the assemblies of Galatia,1.0
29061,Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29064,I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel,1.0
29065,and there isnt another gospel Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Gospel of Christ,1.0
29067,As we have said before so I now say again if any man preaches to you any gospel other than that which you received let him be cursed,1.0
29071,For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it,1.0
29073,But when it was the good pleasure of God who separated me from my mothers womb and called me through his grace,1.0
29074,to reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the Gentiles I didnt immediately confer with flesh and blood,1.0
29075,nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me but I went away into Arabia Then I returned to Damascus,1.0
29076,Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter and stayed with him fifteen days,1.0
29077,But of the other apostles I saw no one except James the Lords brother,1.0
29080,I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,1.0
29081,but they only heard He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy,1.0
29082,And they glorified God in me,1.0
29086,This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage,1.0
29088,But from those who were reputed to be important whatever they were it makes no difference to me God doesnt show partiality to manthey I say who were respected imparted nothing to me,1.0
29089,but to the contrary when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Gospel for the uncircumcision even as Peter with the Gospel for the circumcision,1.0
29092,They only asked us to remember the poorwhich very thing I was also zealous to do,1.0
29094,For before some people came from James he ate with the Gentiles But when they came he drew back and separated himself fearing those who were of the circumcision,1.0
29095,And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy,1.0
29096,But when I saw that they didnt walk uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said to Peter before them all If you being a Jew live as the Gentiles do and not as the Jews do why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do,1.0
29097,We being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners,1.0
29100,For if I build up again those things which I destroyed I prove myself a lawbreaker,1.0
29101,For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God,1.0
29102,I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I that live but Christ living in me That life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me,1.0
29103,I dont make void the grace of God For if righteousness is through the law then Christ died for nothing!,1.0
29106,Are you so foolish Having begun in the Spirit are you now completed in the flesh,1.0
29107,Did you suffer so many things in vain if it is indeed in vain,1.0
29108,He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you does he do it by the works of the law or by hearing of faith,1.0
29109,Even as Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness,1.0
29113,For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse For it is written Cursed is everyone who doesnt continue in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them,1.0
29114,Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident for The righteous will live by faith,1.0
29116,Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law having become a curse for us For it is written Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,1.0
29117,that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith,1.0
29118,Brothers I speak like men Though it is only a mans covenant yet when it has been confirmed no one makes it void or adds to it,1.0
29124,Is the law then against the promises of God Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive most assuredly righteousness would have been of the law,1.0
29125,But the Scriptures shut up all things under sin that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe,1.0
29126,But before faith came we were kept in custody under the law shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed,1.0
29127,So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith,1.0
29128,But now that faith has come we are no longer under a tutor,1.0
29129,For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus,1.0
29130,For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ,1.0
29131,There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither slave nor free man there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus,1.0
29133,But I say that so long as the heir is a child he is no different from a bondservant though he is lord of all,1.0
29134,but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father,1.0
29135,So we also when we were children were held in bondage under the elements of the world,1.0
29137,that he might redeem those who were under the law that we might receive the adoption of children,1.0
29138,And because you are children God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts crying Abba{Abba is a Greek spelling for the Chaldee word for Father or Daddy used in a familiar respectful and loving way} Father!,1.0
29139,So you are no longer a bondservant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ,1.0
29140,However at that time not knowing God you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods,1.0
29141,But now that you have come to know God or rather to be known by God why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elements to which you desire to be in bondage all over again,1.0
29142,You observe days months seasons and years,1.0
29143,I am afraid for you that I might have wasted my labor for you,1.0
29145,but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Gospel to you the first time,1.0
29146,That which was a temptation to you in my flesh you didnt despise nor reject but you received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus,1.0
29148,So then have I become your enemy by telling you the truth,1.0
29150,But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause and not only when I am present with you,1.0
29152,but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone for I am perplexed about you,1.0
29153,Tell me you that desire to be under the law dont you listen to the law,1.0
29154,For it is written that Abraham had two sons one by the handmaid and one by the free woman,1.0
29157,For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now for she is in bondage with her children,1.0
29158,But the Jerusalem that is above is free which is the mother of us all,1.0
29161,But as then he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit so also it is now,1.0
29162,However what does the Scripture say Throw out the handmaid and her son for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman,1.0
29164,Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free and dont be entangled again with a yoke of bondage,1.0
29165,Behold I Paul tell you that if you receive circumcision Christ will profit you nothing,1.0
29166,Yes I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law,1.0
29167,You are alienated from Christ you who desire to be justified by the law You have fallen away from grace,1.0
29168,For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness,1.0
29169,For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything nor uncircumcision but faith working through love,1.0
29172,A little yeast grows through the whole lump,1.0
29175,I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off,1.0
29179,But I say walk by the Spirit and you wont fulfill the lust of the flesh,1.0
29180,For the flesh lusts against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh and these are contrary to one other that you may not do the things that you desire,1.0
29181,But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law,1.0
29183,idolatry sorcery hatred strife jealousies outbursts of anger rivalries divisions heresies,1.0
29184,envyings murders drunkenness orgies and things like these of which I forewarn you even as I also forewarned you that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God,1.0
29186,gentleness and selfcontrol Against such things there is no law,1.0
29189,Lets not become conceited provoking one another and envying one another,1.0
29191,Bear one anothers burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ,1.0
29192,For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceives himself,1.0
29193,But let each man test his own work and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor,1.0
29194,For each man will bear his own burden,1.0
29196,Dont be deceived God is not mocked for whatever a man sows that will he also reap,1.0
29197,For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life,1.0
29198,Let us not be weary in doing good for we will reap in due season if we dont give up,1.0
29199,So then as we have opportunity lets do what is good toward all men and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith,1.0
29200,See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand,1.0
29203,But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world,1.0
29204,For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision but a new creation,1.0
29205,As many as walk by this rule peace and mercy be on them and on Gods Israel,1.0
29208,Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God to the saints who are at Ephesus and the faithful in Christ Jesus,1.0
29209,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29210,Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,1.0
29211,even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love,1.0
29213,to the praise of the glory of his grace by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,1.0
29214,in whom we have our redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace,1.0
29215,which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,1.0
29216,making known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him,1.0
29217,to an administration of the fullness of the times to sum up all things in Christ the things in the heavens and the things on the earth in him,1.0
29218,in whom also we were assigned an inheritance having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will,1.0
29221,who is a pledge of our inheritance to the redemption of Gods own possession to the praise of his glory,1.0
29223,dont cease to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers,1.0
29224,that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him,1.0
29226,and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe according to that working of the strength of his might,1.0
29227,which he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,1.0
29228,far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come,1.0
29232,in which you once walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the powers of the air the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience,1.0
29233,among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest,1.0
29234,But God being rich in mercy for his great love with which he loved us,1.0
29237,that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus,1.0
29239,not of works that no one would boast,1.0
29240,For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared before that we would walk in them,1.0
29241,Therefore remember that once you the Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands,1.0
29242,that you were at that time separate from Christ alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of the promise having no hope and without God in the world,1.0
29243,But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ,1.0
29245,having abolished in the flesh the hostility the law of commandments contained in ordinances that he might create in himself one new man of the two making peace,1.0
29246,and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross having killed the hostility thereby,1.0
29248,For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father,1.0
29249,So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners but you are fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God,1.0
29255,how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me as I wrote before in few words,1.0
29256,by which when you read you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,1.0
29259,of which I was made a servant according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power,1.0
29260,To me the very least of all saints was this grace given to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,1.0
29261,and to make all men see what is the administration{TR reads fellowship instead of administration} of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things through Jesus Christ,1.0
29263,according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,1.0
29264,in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him,1.0
29266,For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29267,from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,1.0
29268,that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man,1.0
29271,and to know Christs love which surpasses knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God,1.0
29273,to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever Amen,1.0
29274,I therefore the prisoner in the Lord beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,1.0
29277,There is one body and one Spirit even as you also were called in one hope of your calling,1.0
29279,one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in us all,1.0
29280,But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ,1.0
29281,Therefore he says When he ascended on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts to men,1.0
29282,Now this He ascended what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth,1.0
29283,He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things,1.0
29285,for the perfecting of the saints to the work of serving to the building up of the body of Christ,1.0
29286,until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a full grown man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,1.0
29287,that we may no longer be children tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in craftiness after the wiles of error,1.0
29288,but speaking truth in love we may grow up in all things into him who is the head Christ,1.0
29289,from whom all the body being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies according to the working in measure of each individual part makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love,1.0
29291,being darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardening of their hearts,1.0
29292,who having become callous gave themselves up to lust to work all uncleanness with greediness,1.0
29293,But you did not learn Christ that way,1.0
29296,and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,1.0
29297,and put on the new man who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth,1.0
29298,Therefore putting away falsehood speak truth each one with his neighbor For we are members one of another,1.0
29299,Be angry and dont sin Dont let the sun go down on your wrath,1.0
29300,neither give place to the devil,1.0
29301,Let him who stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing that is good that he may have something to give to him who has need,1.0
29302,Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth but such as is good for building up as the need may be that it may give grace to those who hear,1.0
29305,And be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving each other just as God also in Christ forgave you,1.0
29309,nor filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not appropriate but rather giving of thanks,1.0
29311,Let no one deceive you with empty words For because of these things the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience,1.0
29312,Therefore dont be partakers with them,1.0
29313,For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord Walk as children of light,1.0
29316,Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather even reprove them,1.0
29318,But all things when they are reproved are revealed by the light for everything that is revealed is light,1.0
29321,redeeming the time because the days are evil,1.0
29323,Dont be drunken with wine in which is dissipation but be filled with the Spirit,1.0
29324,speaking to one another in psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing and singing praises in your heart to the Lord,1.0
29325,giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God even the Father,1.0
29327,Wives be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord,1.0
29328,For the husband is the head of the wife and Christ also is the head of the assembly being himself the savior of the body,1.0
29329,But as the assembly is subject to Christ so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything,1.0
29330,Husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the assembly and gave himself up for it,1.0
29331,that he might sanctify it having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,1.0
29332,that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish,1.0
29334,For no man ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it even as the Lord also does the assembly,1.0
29335,because we are members of his body of his flesh and bones,1.0
29337,This mystery is great but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly,1.0
29339,Children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right,1.0
29341,that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth,1.0
29342,You fathers dont provoke your children to wrath but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord,1.0
29346,knowing that whatever good thing each one does he will receive the same again from the Lord whether he is bound or free,1.0
29349,Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,1.0
29352,Stand therefore having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,1.0
29353,and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Gospel of peace,1.0
29354,above all taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one,1.0
29355,And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God,1.0
29358,for which I am an ambassador in chains that in it I may speak boldly as I ought to speak,1.0
29359,But that you also may know my affairs how I am doing Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord will make known to you all things,1.0
29363,Paul and Timothy servants of Jesus Christ To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi with the overseers{The word translated overseers episkopos can also be translated superintendents guardians curators or bishops} and deacons{Or servants},1.0
29364,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29367,for your partnership{The word translated partnership koinonia also means fellowship and sharing} in furtherance of the Gospel from the first day until now,1.0
29368,being confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ,1.0
29370,For God is my witness how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus,1.0
29372,so that you may approve the things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ,1.0
29374,Now I desire to have you know brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Gospel,1.0
29376,and that most of the brothers in the Lord being confident through my bonds are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear,1.0
29377,Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife and some also out of good will,1.0
29378,The former insincerly preach Christ from selfish ambition thinking that they add affliction to my chains,1.0
29379,but the latter out of love knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Gospel,1.0
29383,For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain,1.0
29387,Having this confidence I know that I will remain yes and remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,1.0
29388,that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again,1.0
29389,Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or am absent I may hear of your state that you stand firm in one spirit with one soul striving for the faith of the Gospel,1.0
29390,and in nothing frightened by the adversaries which is for them a proof of destruction but to you of salvation and that from God,1.0
29391,Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer on his behalf,1.0
29392,having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me,1.0
29394,make my joy full by being likeminded having the same love being of one accord of one mind,1.0
29395,doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit but in humility each counting others better than himself,1.0
29396,each of you not just looking to his own things but each of you also to the things of others,1.0
29397,Have this in your mind which was also in Christ Jesus,1.0
29401,Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave to him the name which is above every name,1.0
29406,Do all things without murmurings and disputes,1.0
29407,that you may become blameless and harmless children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you are seen as lights in the world,1.0
29408,holding up the word of life that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ that I didnt run in vain nor labor in vain,1.0
29410,In the same way you also rejoice and rejoice with me,1.0
29411,But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing,1.0
29414,But you know the proof of him that as a child serves a father so he served with me in furtherance of the Gospel,1.0
29415,Therefore I hope to send him at once as soon as I see how it will go with me,1.0
29418,since he longed for you all and was very troubled because you had heard that he was sick,1.0
29420,I have sent him therefore the more diligently that when you see him again you may rejoice and that I may be the less sorrowful,1.0
29421,Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy and hold such in honor,1.0
29423,Finally my brothers rejoice in the Lord To write the same things to you to me indeed is not tiresome but for you it is safe,1.0
29427,circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews concerning the law a Pharisee,1.0
29430,Yes most assuredly and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I suffered the loss of all things and count them nothing but refuse that I may gain Christ,1.0
29431,and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that which is of the law but that which is through faith in Christ the righteousness which is from God by faith,1.0
29432,that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings becoming conformed to his death,1.0
29434,Not that I have already obtained or am already made perfect but I press on if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus,1.0
29436,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,1.0
29437,Let us therefore as many as are perfect think this way If in anything you think otherwise God will also reveal that to you,1.0
29438,Nevertheless to the extent that we have already attained let us walk by the same rule Let us be of the same mind,1.0
29439,Brothers be imitators together of me and note those who walk this way even as you have us for an example,1.0
29441,whose end is destruction whose god is the belly and whose glory is in their shame who think about earthly things,1.0
29442,For our citizenship is in heaven from where we also wait for a Savior the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29445,I exhort Euodia and I exhort Syntyche to think the same way in the Lord,1.0
29446,Yes I beg you also true yokefellow help these women for they labored with me in the Gospel with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life,1.0
29447,Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say Rejoice!,1.0
29448,Let your gentleness be known to all men The Lord is at hand,1.0
29450,And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus,1.0
29451,Finally brothers whatever things are true whatever things are honorable whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is any virtue and if there is any praise think about these things,1.0
29452,The things which you learned received heard and saw in me do these things and the God of peace will be with you,1.0
29453,But I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your thought for me in which you did indeed take thought but you lacked opportunity,1.0
29457,However you did well that you shared in my affliction,1.0
29458,You yourselves also know you Philippians that in the beginning of the Gospel when I departed from Macedonia no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only,1.0
29460,Not that I seek for the gift but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account,1.0
29461,But I have all things and abound I am filled having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you a sweetsmelling fragrance an acceptable and wellpleasing sacrifice to God,1.0
29463,Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen,1.0
29464,Greet every saint in Christ Jesus The brothers who are with me greet you,1.0
29468,to the saints and faithful brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} in Christ at Colossae Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29469,We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you,1.0
29470,having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have toward all the saints,1.0
29471,because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel,1.0
29472,which has come to you even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing as it does in you also since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth,1.0
29473,even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,1.0
29475,For this cause we also since the day we heard this dont cease praying and making requests for you that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,1.0
29476,that you may walk worthily of the Lord to please him in all respects bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God,1.0
29478,giving thanks to the Father who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light,1.0
29479,who delivered us out of the power of darkness and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love,1.0
29482,For by him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth things visible and things invisible whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things have been created through him and for him,1.0
29483,He is before all things and in him all things are held together,1.0
29484,He is the head of the body the assembly who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence,1.0
29486,and through him to reconcile all things to himself by him whether things on the earth or things in the heavens having made peace through the blood of his cross,1.0
29487,You being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,1.0
29488,yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,1.0
29489,if it is so that you continue in the faith grounded and steadfast and not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you heard which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven of which I Paul was made a servant,1.0
29492,the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations But now it has been revealed to his saints,1.0
29493,to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory,1.0
29494,whom we proclaim admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,1.0
29495,for which I also labor striving according to his working which works in me mightily,1.0
29496,For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you and for those at Laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,1.0
29498,in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden,1.0
29501,As therefore you received Christ Jesus the Lord walk in him,1.0
29502,rooted and built up in him and established in the faith even as you were taught abounding in it in thanksgiving,1.0
29503,Be careful that you dont let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the elements of the world and not after Christ,1.0
29505,and in him you are made full who is the head of all principality and power,1.0
29506,in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ,1.0
29507,having been buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God who raised him from the dead,1.0
29508,You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh He made you alive together with him having forgiven us all our trespasses,1.0
29510,having stripped the principalities and the powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it,1.0
29514,and not holding firmly to the Head from whom all the body being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments grows with Gods growth,1.0
29515,If you died with Christ from the elements of the world why as though living in the world do you subject yourselves to ordinances,1.0
29517,all of which perish with use according to the precepts and doctrines of men,1.0
29519,If then you were raised together with Christ seek the things that are above where Christ is seated on the right hand of God,1.0
29520,Set your mind on the things that are above not on the things that are on the earth,1.0
29521,For you died and your life is hidden with Christ in God,1.0
29522,When Christ our life is revealed then you will also be revealed with him in glory,1.0
29524,for which things sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience,1.0
29526,but now you also put them all away anger wrath malice slander and shameful speaking out of your mouth,1.0
29527,Dont lie to one another seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,1.0
29528,and have put on the new man that is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,1.0
29530,Put on therefore as Gods chosen ones holy and beloved a heart of compassion kindness lowliness humility and perseverance,1.0
29533,And let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also you were called in one body and be thankful,1.0
29534,Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your heart to the Lord,1.0
29535,Whatever you do in word or in deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through him,1.0
29536,Wives be in subjection to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord,1.0
29537,Husbands love your wives and dont be bitter against them,1.0
29539,Fathers dont provoke your children so that they wont be discouraged,1.0
29540,Servants obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh not just when they are looking as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God,1.0
29544,Masters give to your servants that which is just and equal knowing that you also have a Master in heaven,1.0
29546,praying together for us also that God may open to us a door for the word to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds,1.0
29547,that I may reveal it as I ought to speak,1.0
29548,Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside redeeming the time,1.0

29564,remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father,1.0
29565,We know brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} loved by God that you are chosen,1.0
29566,and that our Gospel came to you not in word only but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with much assurance You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake,1.0
29567,You became imitators of us and of the Lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit,1.0
29568,so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia,1.0
29570,For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,1.0
29572,For you yourselves know brothers our visit to you wasnt in vain,1.0
29574,For our exhortation is not of error nor of uncleanness nor in deception,1.0
29576,For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery as you know nor a cloak of covetousness God is witness,1.0
29577,nor seeking glory from men neither from you nor from others when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ,1.0
29579,Even so affectionately longing for you we were well pleased to impart to you not the Gospel of God only but also our own souls because you had become very dear to us,1.0
29580,For you remember brothers our labor and travail for working night and day that we might not burden any of you we preached to you the Gospel of God,1.0
29582,As you know how we exhorted comforted and implored every one of you as a father does his own children,1.0
29583,to the end that you should walk worthily of God who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory,1.0
29584,For this cause we also thank God without ceasing that when you received from us the word of the message of God you accepted it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which also works in you who believe,1.0
29586,who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets and drove us out and didnt please God and are contrary to all men,1.0
29589,because we wanted to come to youindeed I Paul once and again but Satan hindered us,1.0
29590,For what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing Isnt it even you before our Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ} at his coming,1.0
29591,For you are our glory and our joy,1.0
29593,and sent Timothy our brother and Gods servant in the Gospel of Christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith,1.0
29594,that no one be moved by these afflictions For you know that we are appointed to this task,1.0
29595,For most assuredly when we were with you we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction even as it happened and you know,1.0
29596,For this cause I also when I couldnt stand it any longer sent that I might know your faith for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you and our labor would have been in vain,1.0
29598,for this cause brothers we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith,1.0
29599,For now we live if you stand fast in the Lord,1.0
29600,For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God,1.0
29602,Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you,1.0
29607,For this is the will of God your sanctification that you abstain from sexual immorality,1.0
29608,that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,1.0
29609,not in the passion of lust even as the Gentiles who dont know God,1.0
29611,For God called us not for uncleanness but in sanctification,1.0
29612,Therefore he who rejects doesnt reject man but God who has also given his Holy Spirit to you,1.0
29614,for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia But we exhort you brothers that you abound more and more,1.0
29615,and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and to do your own business and to work with your own hands even as we charged you,1.0
29616,that you may walk properly toward those who are outside and may have need of nothing,1.0
29617,But we dont want you to be ignorant brothers concerning those who have fallen asleep so that you dont grieve like the rest who have no hope,1.0
29618,For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so those who have fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him,1.0
29621,then we who are alive who are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air So we will be with the Lord forever,1.0
29623,But concerning the times and the seasons brothers you have no need that anything be written to you,1.0
29625,For when they are saying Peace and safety then sudden destruction will come on them like birth pains on a pregnant woman and they will in no way escape,1.0
29626,But you brothers arent in darkness that the day should overtake you like a thief,1.0
29627,You are all children of light and children of the day We dont belong to the night nor to darkness,1.0
29630,But let us since we belong to the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation,1.0
29631,For God didnt appoint us to wrath but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29633,Therefore exhort one another and build each other up even as you also do,1.0
29634,But we beg you brothers to know those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,1.0
29635,and to respect and honor them in love for their works sake Be at peace among yourselves,1.0
29637,See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all,1.0
29638,Rejoice always,1.0
29639,Pray without ceasing,1.0
29640,In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you,1.0
29642,Dont despise prophesies,1.0
29644,Abstain from every form of evil,1.0
29645,May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely May your whole spirit soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29649,I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers,1.0
29650,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you Amen,1.0
29652,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29654,so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure,1.0
29655,This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God for which you also suffer,1.0
29658,giving vengeance to those who dont know God and to those who dont obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus,1.0
29661,To this end we also pray always for you that our God may count you worthy of your calling and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith with power,1.0
29664,not to be quickly shaken in your mind nor yet be troubled either by spirit or by word or by letter as from us saying that the day of Christ had come,1.0
29670,Then the lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the brightness of his coming,1.0
29671,even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,1.0
29673,Because of this God sends them a working of error that they should believe a lie,1.0
29674,that they all might be judged who didnt believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness,1.0
29675,But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you brothers loved by the Lord because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth,1.0
29676,to which he called you through our Gospel for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29677,So then brothers stand firm and hold the traditions which you were taught by us whether by word or by letter,1.0
29679,comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word,1.0
29681,and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men for not all have faith,1.0
29682,But the Lord is faithful who will establish you and guard you from the evil one,1.0
29687,neither did we eat bread from anyones hand without paying for it but in labor and travail worked night and day that we might not burden any of you,1.0
29689,For even when we were with you we commanded you this If anyone will not work neither let him eat,1.0
29690,For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion who dont work at all but are busybodies,1.0
29691,Now those who are that way we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread,1.0
29695,Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways The Lord be with you all,1.0
29697,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen,1.0
29698,Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope,1.0
29699,to Timothy my true child in faith Grace mercy and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord,1.0
29700,As I exhorted you to stay at Ephesus when I was going into Macedonia that you might charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,1.0
29701,neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies which cause disputes rather than Gods stewardship which is in faith,1.0
29703,from which things some having missed the mark have turned aside to vain talking,1.0
29705,But we know that the law is good if a man uses it lawfully,1.0
29707,for the sexually immoral for homosexuals for slavetraders for liars for perjurers and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine,1.0
29708,according to the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God which was committed to my trust,1.0
29709,And I thank him who enabled me Christ Jesus our Lord because he counted me faithful appointing me to service,1.0
29711,The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus,1.0
29712,The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief,1.0
29714,Now to the King eternal immortal invisible to God who alone is wise be honor and glory forever and ever Amen,1.0
29717,of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I delivered to Satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme,1.0
29718,I exhort therefore first of all that petitions prayers intercessions and givings of thanks be made for all men,1.0
29719,for kings and all who are in high places that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence,1.0
29720,For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,1.0
29723,who gave himself as a ransom for all the testimony in its own times,1.0
29724,to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle I am telling the truth in Christ not lying a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth,1.0
29726,In the same way that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing with modesty and propriety not just with braided hair gold pearls or expensive clothing,1.0
29727,but which becomes women professing godliness with good works,1.0
29728,Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection,1.0
29730,For Adam was first formed then Eve,1.0
29731,Adam wasnt deceived but the woman being deceived has fallen into disobedience,1.0
29732,but she will be saved through her childbearing if they continue in faith love and sanctification with sobriety,1.0
29733,This is a faithful saying if a man seeks the office of an overseer{Or bishop} he desires a good work,1.0
29734,The overseer therefore must be without reproach the husband of one wife temperate sensible modest hospitable good at teaching,1.0
29736,one who rules his own house well having children in subjection with all reverence,1.0
29738,not a new convert lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil,1.0
29739,Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil,1.0
29743,Their wives in the same way must be reverent not slanderers temperate faithful in all things,1.0
29746,These things I write to you hoping to come to you shortly,1.0
29747,but if I wait long that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God which is the assembly of the living God the pillar and ground of the truth,1.0
29748,Without controversy the mystery of godliness is great God was revealed in the flesh Justified in the spirit Seen by angels Preached among the nations Believed on in the world And received up in glory,1.0
29749,But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,1.0
29750,through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron,1.0
29751,forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth,1.0
29753,For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer,1.0
29754,If you instruct the brothers of these things you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus nourished in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed,1.0
29755,But refuse profane and old wives fables Exercise yourself toward godliness,1.0
29757,This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance,1.0
29758,For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach because we have set our trust in the living God who is the Savior of all men especially of those who believe,1.0
29762,Dont neglect the gift that is in you which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders,1.0
29763,Be diligent in these things Give yourself wholly to them that your progress may be revealed to all,1.0
29764,Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching Continue in these things for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you,1.0
29765,Dont rebuke an older man but exhort him as a father the younger men as brothers,1.0
29767,Honor widows who are widows indeed,1.0
29770,But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives,1.0
29771,Also command these things that they may be without reproach,1.0
29773,Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old having been the wife of one man,1.0
29775,But refuse younger widows for when they have grown wanton against Christ they desire to marry,1.0
29777,Besides they also learn to be idle going about from house to house Not only idle but also gossips and busybodies saying things which they ought not,1.0
29780,If any man or woman who believes has widows let them relieve them and dont let the assembly be burdened that it might relieve those who are widows indeed,1.0
29781,Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in the word and in teaching,1.0
29782,For the Scripture says You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain And The laborer is worthy of his wages,1.0
29783,Dont receive an accusation against an elder except at the word of two or three witnesses,1.0
29785,I charge you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels that you observe these things without prejudice doing nothing by partiality,1.0
29787,Be no longer a drinker of water only but use a little wine for your stomachs sake and your frequent infirmities,1.0
29788,Some mens sins are evident preceding them to judgment and some also follow later,1.0
29789,In the same way also there are good works that are obvious and those that are otherwise cant be hidden,1.0
29791,Those who have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brothers but rather let them serve them because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved Teach and exhort these things,1.0
29793,he is conceited knowing nothing but obsessed with arguments disputes and word battles from which come envy strife reviling evil suspicions,1.0
29794,constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth who suppose that godliness is a means of gain Withdraw yourself from such,1.0
29796,For we brought nothing into the world and we certainly cant carry anything out,1.0
29797,But having food and clothing we will be content with that,1.0
29798,But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts such as drown men in ruin and destruction,1.0
29799,For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows,1.0
29800,But you man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience and gentleness,1.0
29801,Fight the good fight of faith Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses,1.0
29803,that you keep the commandment without spot blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29805,who alone has immortality dwelling in unapproachable light whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be honor and eternal power Amen,1.0
29808,laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold of eternal life,1.0
29810,which some professing have erred concerning the faith Grace be with you Amen,1.0
29811,Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,1.0
29813,I thank God whom I serve as my forefathers did with a pure conscience How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions night and day,1.0
29814,longing to see you remembering your tears that I may be filled with joy,1.0
29815,having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and I am persuaded in you also,1.0
29816,For this cause I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands,1.0
29817,For God didnt give us a spirit of fear but of power love and selfcontrol,1.0
29818,Therefore dont be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but endure hardship for the Gospel according to the power of God,1.0
29819,who saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,1.0
29820,but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel,1.0
29822,For this cause I suffer also these things Yet I am not ashamed for I know him whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day,1.0
29823,Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus,1.0
29824,That good thing which was committed to you guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us,1.0
29825,This you know that all who are in Asia turned away from me of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes,1.0
29826,May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain,1.0
29828,the Lord grant to him to find the Lords mercy in that day and in how many things he served at Ephesus you know very well,1.0
29830,The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses commit the same to faithful men who will be able to teach others also,1.0
29831,You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus,1.0
29833,Also if anyone competes in athletics he isnt crowned unless he has competed by the rules,1.0
29834,The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops,1.0
29837,in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal But Gods word isnt chained,1.0
29838,Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones sake that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory,1.0
29839,This saying is faithful For if we died with him We will also live with him,1.0
29841,If we are faithless He remains faithful He cant deny himself,1.0
29842,Remind them of these things charging them in the sight of the Lord that they dont argue about words to no profit to the subverting of those who hear,1.0
29843,Give diligence to present yourself approved by God a workman who doesnt need to be ashamed properly handling the Word of Truth,1.0
29844,But shun empty chatter for they will proceed further in ungodliness,1.0
29846,men who have erred concerning the truth saying that the resurrection is already past and overthrowing the faith of some,1.0
29847,However Gods firm foundation stands having this seal The Lord knows those who are his and Let every one who names the name of the Lord{TR reads Christ instead of the Lord} depart from unrighteousness,1.0
29848,Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of clay Some are for honor and some for dishonor,1.0
29849,If anyone therefore purges himself from these he will be a vessel for honor sanctified and suitable for the masters use prepared for every good work,1.0
29850,Flee from youthful lusts but pursue righteousness faith love and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart,1.0
29852,The Lords servant must not quarrel but be gentle towards all able to teach patient,1.0
29853,in gentleness correcting those who oppose him perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,1.0
29854,and they may recover themselves out of the devils snare having been taken captive by him to his will,1.0
29855,But know this that in the last days grievous times will come,1.0
29856,For men will be lovers of self lovers of money boastful arrogant blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy,1.0
29857,without natural affection unforgiving slanderers without selfcontrol fierce no lovers of good,1.0
29858,traitors headstrong conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,1.0
29859,holding a form of godliness but having denied the power thereof Turn away from these also,1.0
29864,But you did follow my teaching conduct purpose faith patience love steadfastness,1.0
29867,But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse deceiving and being deceived,1.0
29868,But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of knowing from whom you have learned them,1.0
29869,From infancy you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus,1.0
29870,Every writing inspired by God{literally Godbreathed} is profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for instruction which is in righteousness,1.0
29871,that the man of God may be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work,1.0
29872,I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom,1.0
29873,preach the word be urgent in season and out of season reprove rebuke and exhort with all patience and teaching,1.0
29874,For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine but having itching ears will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts,1.0
29883,But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus,1.0
29884,Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come and the books especially the parchments,1.0
29885,Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me The Lord will repay him according to his works,1.0
29886,of whom you also must beware for he greatly opposed our words,1.0

29901,but given to hospitality as a lover of good soberminded fair holy selfcontrolled,1.0
29902,holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine and to convict those who contradict him,1.0
29903,For there are also many unruly men vain talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision,1.0
29906,This testimony is true For this cause reprove them sharply that they may be sound in the faith,1.0
29907,not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth,1.0
29909,They profess that they know God but by their works they deny him being abominable disobedient and unfit for any good work,1.0
29910,But say the things which fit sound doctrine,1.0
29913,that they may train the young women to love their husbands to love their children,1.0
29916,in all things showing yourself an example of good works in your teaching showing integrity seriousness incorruptibility,1.0

29919,not stealing but showing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things,1.0
29920,For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all men,1.0
29921,instructing us to the intent that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we would live soberly righteously and godly in this present world,1.0
29922,looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,1.0
29923,who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession zealous for good works,1.0
29924,Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority Let no man despise you,1.0
29925,Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities to be obedient to be ready for every good work,1.0
29926,to speak evil of no one not to be contentious to be gentle showing all humility toward all men,1.0
29927,For we were also once foolish disobedient deceived serving various lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another,1.0
29928,But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,1.0
29931,that being justified by his grace we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life,1.0
29933,but shun foolish questionings genealogies strife and disputes about the law for they are unprofitable and vain,1.0
29934,Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,1.0
29935,knowing that such a one is perverted and sins being selfcondemned,1.0
29936,When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis for I have determined to winter there,1.0
29937,Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily that nothing may be lacking for them,1.0
29938,Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they may not be unfruitful,1.0
29939,All who are with me greet you Greet those who love us in faith Grace be with you all Amen,1.0
29942,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
29944,hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,1.0
29945,that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus,1.0
29947,Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,1.0
29948,yet for loves sake I rather beg being such a one as Paul the aged but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ,1.0
29950,who once was useless to you but now is useful to you and to me,1.0
29951,I am sending him back Therefore receive him that is my own heart,1.0
29953,But I was willing to do nothing without your consent that your goodness would not be as of necessity but of free will,1.0
29955,no longer as a slave but more than a slave a beloved brother especially to me but how much rather to you both in the flesh and in the Lord,1.0
29956,If then you count me a partner receive him as you would receive me,1.0
29958,I Paul write this with my own hand I will repay it not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides,1.0
29959,Yes brother let me have joy from you in the Lord Refresh my heart in the Lord,1.0
29961,Also prepare a guest room for me for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you,1.0
29962,Epaphras my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus greets you,1.0
29963,as do Mark Aristarchus Demas and Luke my fellow workers,1.0
29964,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Amen,1.0
29965,God having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,1.0
29966,has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom also he made the worlds,1.0
29967,His Son is the radiance of his glory the very image of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself made purification for our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,1.0
29969,For to which of the angels did he say at any time  You are my Son Today have I become your father and again  I will be to him a Father And he will be to me a Son,1.0
29970,Again when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says Let all the angels of God worship him,1.0
29972,but of the Son he says Your throne O God is forever and ever The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom,1.0
29973,You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity Therefore God your God has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows,1.0
29974,And You Lord in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth The heavens are the works of your hands,1.0
29976,As a mantle you will roll them up And they will be changed But you are the same Your years will not fail,1.0
29978,Arent they all ministering spirits sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation,1.0
29979,Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard lest perhaps we drift away,1.0
29980,For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,1.0
29982,God also bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his own will,1.0
29984,But one has somewhere testified saying What is man that you think of him Or the son of man that you care for him,1.0
29985,You made him a little lower than the angels You crowned him with glory and honor{TR adds and set him over the works of your hands},1.0
29986,You have put all things in subjection under his feet For in that he subjected all things to him he left nothing that is not subject to him But now we dont see all things subjected to him yet,1.0
29988,For it became him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many children to glory to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings,1.0
29990,saying I will declare your name to my brothers In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise,1.0
29991,Again I will put my trust in him Again Behold here am I and the children whom God has given me,1.0
29992,Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood he also himself in like manner partook of the same that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death that is the devil,1.0
29995,Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make atonement for the sins of the people,1.0
29996,For in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to help those who are tempted,1.0
29998,who was faithful to him who appointed him as also was Moses in all his house,1.0
29999,For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house,1.0
30000,For every house is built by someone but he who built all things is God,1.0
30001,Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,1.0
30002,but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house whose house we are if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end,1.0
30004,Dont harden your hearts as in the provocation Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,1.0
30005,Where your fathers tested me by proving me And saw my works for forty years,1.0
30007,As I swore in my wrath They will not enter into my rest,1.0
30008,Beware brothers lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in falling away from the living God,1.0
30010,For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,1.0
30012,For who when they heard rebelled No didnt all those who came out of Egypt by Moses,1.0
30013,With whom was he displeased forty years Wasnt it with those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness,1.0
30015,We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief,1.0
30019,For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day God rested on the seventh day from all his works,1.0
30021,Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,1.0
30022,he again defines a certain day today saying through David so long a time afterward just as has been said Today if you will hear his voice Dont harden your hearts,1.0
30023,For if Joshua had given them rest he would not have spoken afterward of another day,1.0
30024,There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God,1.0
30025,For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works as God did from his,1.0
30026,Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience,1.0
30028,There is no creature that is hidden from his sight but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do,1.0
30030,For we dont have a high priest who cant be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but one who has been in all points tempted like we are yet without sin,1.0
30032,For every high priest being taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,1.0
30033,The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray because he himself is also surrounded with weakness,1.0
30034,Because of this he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people as well as for himself,1.0
30035,Nobody takes this honor on himself but he is called by God just like Aaron was,1.0
30036,So also Christ didnt glorify himself to be made a high priest but it was he who said to him You are my Son Today I have become your father,1.0
30037,As he says also in another place You are a priest forever After the order of Melchizedek,1.0
30038,He in the days of his flesh having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death and having been heard for his godly fear,1.0
30039,though he was a Son yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered,1.0
30041,named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek,1.0
30044,For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness for he is a baby,1.0
30045,But solid food is for those who are full grown who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil,1.0
30047,of the teaching of baptisms of laying on of hands of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment,1.0
30048,This will we do if God permits,1.0
30049,For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,1.0
30050,and tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,1.0
30052,For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled receives blessing from God,1.0
30053,but if it bears thorns and thistles it is rejected and near being cursed whose end is to be burned,1.0
30056,We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,1.0
30057,that you wont be sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises,1.0
30058,For when God made a promise to Abraham since he could swear by none greater he swore by himself,1.0
30061,For men indeed swear by a greater one and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation,1.0
30062,In this way God being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel interposed with an oath,1.0
30063,that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie we may have a strong encouragement who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us,1.0
30065,where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek,1.0
30067,to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all being first by interpretation king of righteousness and then also king of Salem which is king of peace,1.0
30068,without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like the Son of God remains a priest continually,1.0
30074,So to say through Abraham even Levi who receives tithes has paid tithes,1.0
30075,for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him,1.0
30076,Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood for under it the people have received the law what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron,1.0
30077,For the priesthood being changed there is of necessity a change made also in the law,1.0
30078,For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar,1.0
30079,For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood,1.0
30081,who has been made not after the law of a fleshly commandment but after the power of an endless life,1.0
30082,for it is testified You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek,1.0
30083,For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness,1.0
30084,for the law made nothing perfect and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope through which we draw near to God,1.0
30085,Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath,1.0
30087,By so much has Jesus become the collateral of a better covenant,1.0
30088,Many indeed have been made priests because they are hindered from continuing by death,1.0
30099,But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted on better promises,1.0
30100,For if that first covenant had been faultless then no place would have been sought for a second,1.0
30101,For finding fault with them he said Behold the days come says the Lord That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,1.0
30102,Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt For they didnt continue in my covenant And I disregarded them says the Lord,1.0
30103,For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days says the Lord I will put my laws into their mind I will also write them on their heart I will be to them a God And they will be to me a people,1.0
30104,They will not teach every man his fellow citizen{TR reads neighbor instead of fellow citizen} Every man his brother saying Know the Lord For all will know me From the least of them to the greatest of them,1.0
30105,For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more,1.0
30107,Now indeed even the first{TR adds tabernacle} covenant had ordinances of divine service and an earthly sanctuary,1.0
30111,and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat of which things we cant now speak in detail,1.0
30115,which is a symbol of the present age where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable concerning the conscience of making the worshipper perfect,1.0
30116,being only with meats and drinks and various washings fleshly ordinances imposed until a time of reformation,1.0
30118,nor yet through the blood of goats and calves but through his own blood entered in once for all into the Holy Place having obtained eternal redemption,1.0
30120,how much more will the blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God,1.0
30122,For where a last will and testament is there must of necessity be the death of him who made it,1.0
30127,Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood,1.0
30129,It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these,1.0
30131,nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,1.0
30134,so Christ also having been once offered to bear the sins of many will appear a second time without sin to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation,1.0
30135,For the law having a shadow of the good to come not the very image of the things can never with the same sacrifices year by year which they offer continually make perfect those who draw near,1.0
30136,Or else wouldnt they have ceased to be offered because the worshippers having been once cleansed would have had no more consciousness of sins,1.0
30137,But in those sacrifices there is yearly reminder of sins,1.0
30138,For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins,1.0
30140,In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you had no pleasure,1.0
30141,Then I said Behold I have come In the scroll of the book it is written of me To do your will God,1.0
30142,Previously saying Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didnt desire neither had pleasure in them those which are offered according to the law,1.0
30143,then he has said Behold I have come to do your will He takes away the first that he may establish the second,1.0
30145,Every priest indeed stands day by day ministering and often offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins,1.0
30146,but he when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of God,1.0
30147,from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet,1.0
30148,For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified,1.0
30150,This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days says the Lord I will put my laws on their heart I will also write them on their mind then he says,1.0
30151,I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more,1.0
30152,Now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin,1.0
30154,by the way which he dedicated for us a new and living way through the veil that is to say his flesh,1.0
30156,lets draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our body washed with pure water,1.0
30157,let us hold fast the confession of our hope unyieldingly For he who promised is faithful,1.0
30158,Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,1.0
30159,not forsaking our own assembling together as the custom of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching,1.0
30160,For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,1.0
30161,but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries,1.0
30162,A man who disregards Moses law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses,1.0
30163,How much worse punishment do you think will he be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace,1.0
30164,For we know him who said Vengeance belongs to me says the Lord I will repay Again The Lord will judge his people,1.0
30168,For you both had compassion on me in my chains and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens,1.0
30169,Therefore dont throw away your boldness which has a great reward,1.0
30170,For you need endurance so that having done the will of God you may receive the promise,1.0
30171,In a very little while He who comes will come and will not wait,1.0
30174,Now faith is assurance of things hoped for proof of things not seen,1.0
30175,For by this the elders obtained testimony,1.0
30177,By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous God bearing witness with respect to his gifts and through it he being dead still speaks,1.0
30179,Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him for he who comes to God must believe that he exists and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him,1.0
30180,By faith Noah being warned about things not yet seen moved with godly fear prepared an ark for the saving of his house through which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith,1.0
30182,By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise as in a land not his own dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise,1.0
30183,For he looked for the city which has the foundations whose builder and maker is God,1.0
30184,By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive and she bore a child when she was past age since she counted him faithful who had promised,1.0
30188,If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out they would have had enough time to return,1.0
30189,But now they desire a better country that is a heavenly one Therefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God for he has prepared a city for them,1.0
30190,By faith Abraham being tested offered up Isaac Yes he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son,1.0
30192,accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead Figuratively speaking he also did receive him back from the dead,1.0
30193,By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau even concerning things to come,1.0
30194,By faith Jacob when he was dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning on the top of his staff,1.0
30195,By faith Joseph when his end was near made mention of the departure of the children of Israel and gave instructions concerning his bones,1.0
30196,By faith Moses when he was born was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw that he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid of the kings commandment,1.0
30199,accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he looked to the reward,1.0
30200,By faith he left Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible,1.0
30201,By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them,1.0
30203,By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days,1.0
30204,By faith Rahab the prostitute didnt perish with those who were disobedient having received the spies in peace,1.0
30205,What more shall I say For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon Barak Samson Jephthah David Samuel and the prophets,1.0
30206,who through faith subdued kingdoms worked out righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions,1.0
30207,quenched the power of fire escaped the edge of the sword from weakness were made strong grew mighty in war and turned to flight armies of aliens,1.0
30209,Others were tried by mocking and scourging yes moreover by bonds and imprisonment,1.0
30210,They were stoned They were sawn apart They were tempted They were slain with the sword They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins being destitute afflicted illtreated,1.0
30211,of whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts mountains caves and the holes of the earth,1.0
30213,God having provided some better thing concerning us so that apart from us they should not be made perfect,1.0
30214,Therefore let us also seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,1.0
30215,looking to Jesus the author and perfecter of faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God,1.0
30217,You have not yet resisted to blood striving against sin,1.0
30218,and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children My son dont take lightly the chastening of the Lord Nor faint when you are reproved by him,1.0
30219,For whom the Lord loves he chastens And scourges every son whom he receives,1.0
30220,It is for discipline that you endure God deals with you as with children for what son is there whom his father doesnt discipline,1.0
30221,But if you are without discipline of which all have been made partakers then are you illegitimate and not children,1.0
30223,For they indeed for a few days punished us as seemed good to them but he for our profit that we may be partakers of his holiness,1.0
30224,All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby,1.0
30225,Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,1.0
30226,and make straight paths for your feet so that which is lame may not be dislocated but rather be healed,1.0
30227,Follow after peace with all men and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,1.0
30228,looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby the many be defiled,1.0
30229,lest there be any sexually immoral person or profane person as Esau who sold his birthright for one meal,1.0
30230,For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears,1.0
30232,the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,1.0
30235,But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to innumerable hosts of angels,1.0
30237,to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel,1.0
30238,See that you dont refuse him who speaks For if they didnt escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,1.0
30239,whose voice shook the earth then but now he has promised saying Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens,1.0
30240,This phrase Yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that have been made that those things which are not shaken may remain,1.0
30241,Therefore receiving a Kingdom that cant be shaken let us have grace through which we serve God acceptably with reverence and awe,1.0
30242,for our God is a consuming fire,1.0
30243,Let brotherly love continue,1.0
30244,Dont forget to show hospitality to strangers for in doing so some have entertained angels without knowing it,1.0
30245,Remember those who are in bonds as bound with them and those who are illtreated since you are also in the body,1.0
30248,So that with good courage we say The Lord is my helper I will not fear What can man do to me,1.0
30249,Remember your leaders men who spoke to you the word of God and considering the results of their conduct imitate their faith,1.0
30251,Dont be carried away by various and strange teachings for it is good that the heart be established by grace not by food through which those who were so occupied were not benefited,1.0
30252,We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat,1.0
30254,Therefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered outside of the gate,1.0
30255,Let us therefore go forth to him outside of the camp bearing his reproach,1.0
30256,For we dont have here an enduring city but we seek that which is to come,1.0
30258,But dont forget to be doing good and sharing for with such sacrifices God is well pleased,1.0
30260,Pray for us for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience desiring to live honorably in all things,1.0
30261,I strongly urge you to do this that I may be restored to you sooner,1.0
30262,Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant our Lord Jesus,1.0
30264,But I exhort you brothers endure the word of exhortation for I have written to you in few words,1.0
30265,Know that our brother Timothy has been freed with whom if he comes shortly I will see you,1.0
30266,Greet all of your leaders and all the saints The Italians greet you,1.0
30268,James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion Greetings,1.0
30272,But if any of you lacks wisdom let him ask of God who gives to all liberally and without reproach and it will be given to him,1.0
30273,But let him ask in faith without any doubting for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed,1.0
30274,For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord,1.0
30275,He is a doubleminded man unstable in all his ways,1.0
30278,For the sun arises with the scorching wind and withers the grass and the flower in it falls and the beauty of its appearance perishes So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits,1.0
30282,Then the lust when it has conceived bears sin and the sin when it is full grown brings forth death,1.0
30283,Dont be deceived my beloved brothers,1.0
30286,So then my beloved brothers let every man be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to anger,1.0
30287,for the anger of man doesnt produce the righteousness of God,1.0
30288,Therefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness receive with humility the implanted word which is able to save your souls{or preserve your life},1.0
30289,But be doers of the word and not only hearers deluding your own selves,1.0
30290,For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror,1.0
30291,for he sees himself and goes away and immediately forgets what kind of man he was,1.0
30292,But he who looks into the perfect law the law of freedom and continues not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work this man will be blessed in what he does,1.0
30293,If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesnt bridle his tongue but deceives his heart this mans religion is worthless,1.0
30300,But you have dishonored the poor man Dont the rich oppress you and personally drag you before the courts,1.0
30303,But if you show partiality you commit sin being convicted by the law as transgressors,1.0
30304,For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet stumble in one point he has become guilty of all,1.0
30305,For he who said Do not commit adultery said also Do not commit murder Now if you do not commit adultery but murder you have become a transgressor of the law,1.0
30306,So speak and so do as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom,1.0
30307,For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy Mercy triumphs over judgment,1.0
30308,What good is it my brothers if a man says he has faith but has no works Can faith save him,1.0
30309,And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,1.0
30310,and one of you tells them Go in peace be warmed and filled and yet you didnt give them the things the body needs what good is it,1.0
30314,But do you want to know vain man that faith apart from works is dead,1.0
30315,Wasnt Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar,1.0
30316,You see that faith worked with his works and by works faith was perfected,1.0
30317,and the Scripture was fulfilled which says Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of God,1.0
30318,You see then that by works a man is justified and not only by faith,1.0
30319,In like manner wasnt Rahab the prostitute also justified by works in that she received the messengers and sent them out another way,1.0
30320,For as the body apart from the spirit is dead even so faith apart from works is dead,1.0
30321,Let not many of you be teachers my brothers knowing that we will receive heavier judgment,1.0
30323,Indeed we put bits into the horses mouths so that they may obey us and we guide their whole body,1.0
30325,So the tongue is also a little member and boasts great things See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!,1.0
30326,And the tongue is a fire The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of nature and is set on fire by Gehenna{Gehenna is a name that describes a burning Hell with rotting bodies and unclean things in it},1.0
30327,For every kind of animal bird creeping thing and thing in the sea is tamed and has been tamed by mankind,1.0
30328,But nobody can tame the tongue It is a restless evil full of deadly poison,1.0
30329,With it we bless our God and Father and with it we curse men who are made in the image of God,1.0
30330,Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing My brothers these things ought not to be so,1.0
30331,Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water,1.0
30332,Can a fig tree my brothers yield olives or a vine figs Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water,1.0
30333,Who is wise and understanding among you Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom,1.0
30334,But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart dont boast and dont lie against the truth,1.0
30335,This wisdom is not that which comes down from above but is earthly sensual and demonic,1.0
30336,For where jealousy and selfish ambition are there is confusion and every evil deed,1.0
30338,Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace,1.0
30339,Where do wars and fightings among you come from Dont they come from your pleasures that war in your members,1.0
30340,You lust and dont have You kill covet and cant obtain You fight and make war You dont have because you dont ask,1.0
30342,You adulterers and adulteresses dont you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God,1.0
30343,Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously,1.0
30345,Be subject therefore to God But resist the devil and he will flee from you,1.0
30346,Draw near to God and he will draw near to you Cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you doubleminded,1.0
30347,Lament mourn and weep Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom,1.0
30349,Dont speak against one another brothers He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law But if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law but a judge,1.0
30350,Only one is the lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy But who are you to judge another,1.0
30351,Come now you who say Today or tomorrow lets go into this city and spend a year there trade and make a profit,1.0
30353,For you ought to say If the Lord wills we will both live and do this or that,1.0
30355,To him therefore who knows to do good and doesnt do it to him it is sin,1.0
30356,Come now you rich weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you,1.0
30357,Your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten,1.0
30359,Behold the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields which you have kept back by fraud cry out and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts,1.0
30361,You have condemned you have murdered the righteous one He doesnt resist you,1.0
30364,Dont grumble brothers against one another so that you wont be judged Behold the judge stands at the door,1.0
30365,Take brothers for an example of suffering and of patience the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord,1.0
30367,But above all things my brothers dont swear neither by heaven nor by the earth nor by any other oath but let your yes be yes and your no no so that you dont fall into hypocrisy{TR reads under judgment instead of into hypocrisy},1.0
30368,Is any among you suffering Let him pray Is any cheerful Let him sing praises,1.0
30369,Is any among you sick Let him call for the elders of the assembly and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,1.0
30370,and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick and the Lord will raise him up If he has committed sins he will be forgiven,1.0
30371,Confess your offenses to one another and pray one for another that you may be healed The effective earnest prayer of a righteous man is powerfully effective,1.0
30372,Elijah was a man with a nature like ours and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it didnt rain on the earth for three years and six months,1.0
30374,Brothers if any among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back,1.0
30378,Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,1.0
30379,to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesnt fade away reserved in heaven for you,1.0
30380,who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time,1.0
30381,Wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a little while if need be you have been put to grief in various trials,1.0
30383,whom not having known you love in whom though now you dont see him yet believing you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory,1.0
30384,receiving the result of your faith the salvation of your souls,1.0
30386,searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed to when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow them,1.0
30387,To them it was revealed that not to themselves but to you did they minister these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven which things angels desire to look into,1.0
30388,Therefore prepare your minds for action{Literally gird up the loins of your mind} be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ,1.0
30391,because it is written You shall be holy for I am holy,1.0
30393,knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things with silver or gold from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,1.0
30397,Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection love one another from the heart fervently,1.0
30398,having been born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible through the word of God which lives and remains forever,1.0
30400,But the Lords word endures forever This is the word of good news which was preached to you,1.0
30401,Putting away therefore all wickedness all deceit hypocrisies envies and all evil speaking,1.0
30404,coming to him a living stone rejected indeed by men but chosen by God precious,1.0
30405,You also as living stones are built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ,1.0
30407,For you therefore who believe is the honor but for such as are disobedient The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,1.0
30408,and A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense For they stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed,1.0
30409,But you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for Gods own possession that you may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light,1.0
30411,Beloved I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,1.0
30413,Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake whether to the king as supreme,1.0
30414,or to governors as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well,1.0
30415,For this is the will of God that by welldoing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,1.0
30416,as free and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness but as bondservants of God,1.0
30417,Honor all men Love the brotherhood Fear God Honor the king,1.0
30418,Servants be in subjection to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the wicked,1.0
30420,For what glory is it if when you sin you patiently endure beating But if when you do well you patiently endure suffering this is commendable with God,1.0
30421,For to this you were called because Christ also suffered for us leaving you{TR reads us instead of you} an example that you should follow his steps,1.0
30422,who did not sin neither was deceit found in his mouth,1.0
30423,Who when he was cursed didnt curse back When he suffered didnt threaten but committed himself to him who judges righteously,1.0
30424,who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree that we having died to sins might live to righteousness by whose stripes you were healed,1.0
30425,For you were going astray like sheep but are now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer{Overseer is from the Greek episkopon which can mean overseer curator guardian or superintendent} of your souls,1.0
30427,seeing your pure behavior in fear,1.0
30429,but in the hidden person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God very precious,1.0
30430,For this is how the holy women before who hoped in God also adorned themselves being in subjection to their own husbands,1.0
30431,as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him lord whose children you now are if you do well and are not put in fear by any terror,1.0
30432,You husbands in like manner live with your wives according to knowledge giving honor to the woman as to the weaker vessel as being also joint heirs of the grace of life that your prayers may not be hindered,1.0
30435,For He who would love life And see good days Let him keep his tongue from evil And his lips from speaking deceit,1.0
30436,Let him turn away from evil and do good Let him seek peace and pursue it,1.0
30438,Now who is he who will harm you if you become imitators of that which is good,1.0
30439,But even if you should suffer for righteousness sake you are blessed Dont fear what they fear neither be troubled,1.0
30440,But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you with humility and fear,1.0
30441,having a good conscience that while you are spoken against as evildoers they may be disappointed who curse your good manner of life in Christ,1.0
30442,For it is better if the will of God should so will that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil,1.0
30444,in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,1.0
30445,who before were disobedient when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built In it few that is eight souls were saved through water,1.0
30447,who is at the right hand of God having gone into heaven angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him,1.0
30449,that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men but for the will of God,1.0
30450,For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles and having walked in lewdness lusts drunken binges orgies carousings and abominable idolatries,1.0
30452,who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead,1.0
30454,But the end of all things is near Therefore be of sound mind selfcontrolled and sober in prayer,1.0
30456,Be hospitable one to another without grumbling,1.0
30457,According as each has received a gift be ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the grace of God in its various forms,1.0
30460,But because you are partakers of Christs sufferings rejoice that at the revelation of his glory also you may rejoice with exceeding joy,1.0
30461,If you are insulted for the name of Christ blessed are you because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you On their part he is blasphemed but on your part he is glorified,1.0
30463,But if one of you suffers for being a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God in this matter,1.0
30464,For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God If it begins first with us what will happen to those who dont obey the Gospel of God,1.0
30466,Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him as to a faithful Creator,1.0
30467,I exhort the elders among you as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed,1.0
30468,Shepherd the flock of God which is among you exercising the oversight not under compulsion but voluntarily not for dishonest gain but willingly,1.0
30469,neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you but making yourselves examples to the flock,1.0
30471,Likewise you younger ones be subject to the elder Yes all of you gird yourselves with humility to subject yourselves to one another for God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble,1.0
30472,Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time,1.0
30473,casting all your worries on him because he cares for you,1.0
30474,Be sober and selfcontrolled Be watchful Your adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour,1.0
30475,Withstand him steadfast in your faith knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings,1.0
30476,But may the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after you have suffered a little while perfect establish strengthen and settle you,1.0
30477,To him be the glory and the power forever and ever Amen,1.0
30479,She who is in Babylon chosen together with you greets you and so does Mark my son,1.0
30480,Greet one another with a kiss of love Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus Amen,1.0
30482,Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,1.0
30483,seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue,1.0
30484,by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust,1.0
30485,Yes and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence in your faith supply moral excellence and in moral excellence knowledge,1.0
30486,and in knowledge selfcontrol and in selfcontrol patience and in patience godliness,1.0
30488,For if these things are yours and abound they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ,1.0
30489,For he who lacks these things is blind seeing only what is near having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins,1.0
30490,Therefore brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} be more diligent to make your calling and election sure For if you do these things you will never stumble,1.0
30491,For thus will be richly supplied to you the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,1.0
30492,Therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these things though you know them and are established in the present truth,1.0
30493,I think it right as long as I am in this tent to stir you up by reminding you,1.0
30494,knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me,1.0
30495,Yes I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure,1.0
30497,For he received from God the Father honor and glory when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,1.0
30498,This voice we heard come out of heaven when we were with him in the holy mountain,1.0
30499,We have the more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the day star arises in your hearts,1.0
30502,But there also arose false prophets among the people as among you also there will be false teachers who will secretly bring in destructive heresies denying even the Master who bought them bringing on themselves swift destruction,1.0
30504,In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words whose sentence now from of old doesnt linger and their destruction will not slumber,1.0
30505,For if God didnt spare angels when they sinned but cast them down to Tartarus{Tartarus is another name for Hell} and committed them to pits of darkness to be reserved to judgment,1.0
30506,and didnt spare the ancient world but preserved Noah with seven others a preacher of righteousness when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly,1.0
30507,and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them to destruction having made them an example to those who would live ungodly,1.0
30508,and delivered righteous Lot who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked,1.0
30509,for that righteous man dwelling among them was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds,1.0
30512,whereas angels though greater in might and power dont bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord,1.0
30513,But these as unreasoning creatures born natural animals to be taken and destroyed speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant will in their destroying surely be destroyed,1.0
30515,having eyes full of adultery and who cant cease from sin enticing unsettled souls having a heart trained in greed children of cursing,1.0
30518,These are wells without water clouds driven by a storm for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever,1.0
30523,But it has happened to them according to the true proverb The dog turns to his own vomit again and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire,1.0
30525,that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and the commandments of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior,1.0
30526,knowing this first that in the last days mockers will come walking after their own lusts,1.0
30527,and saying Where is the promise of his coming For from the day that the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation,1.0
30530,But the heavens that now are and the earth by the same word have been stored up for fire being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men,1.0
30536,But according to his promise we look for new heavens and a new earth in which dwells righteousness,1.0
30537,Therefore beloved seeing that you look for these things be diligent to be found in peace without blemish and blameless in his sight,1.0
30538,Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him wrote to you,1.0
30542,That which was from the beginning that which we have heard that which we have seen with our eyes that which we saw and our hands touched concerning the Word of life,1.0
30543,and the life was revealed and we have seen and testify and declare to you the life the eternal life which was with the Father and was revealed to us,1.0
30544,that which we have seen and heard we declare to you that you also may have fellowship with us Yes and our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ,1.0
30545,And we write these things to you that our joy may be fulfilled,1.0
30547,If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness we lie and dont tell the truth,1.0
30548,But if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin,1.0
30549,If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us,1.0
30550,If we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,1.0
30553,And he is the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos an appeasing propitiating or the means of appeasement or propitiation the sacrifice that turns away Gods wrath because of our sin} for our sins and not for ours only but also for the whole world,1.0
30554,This is how we know that we know him if we keep his commandments,1.0
30555,One who says I know him and doesnt keep his commandments is a liar and the truth isnt in him,1.0
30556,But whoever keeps his word Gods love has most assuredly been perfected in him This is how we know that we are in him,1.0
30557,he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked,1.0
30558,Brothers I write no new commandment to you but an old commandment which you had from the beginning The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning,1.0
30559,Again I write a new commandment to you which is true in him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light already shines,1.0
30560,He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness even until now,1.0
30562,But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and doesnt know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes,1.0
30567,For all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life isnt the Fathers but is the worlds,1.0
30568,The world is passing away with its lusts but he who does Gods will remains forever,1.0
30569,Little children these are the end times and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have arisen By this we know that it is the end times,1.0
30571,You have an anointing from the Holy One and you know the truth,1.0
30576,This is the promise which he promised us the eternal life,1.0
30577,These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray,1.0
30580,If you know that he is righteous you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him,1.0
30581,Behold how great a love the Father has bestowed on us that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesnt know us because it didnt know him,1.0
30582,Beloved now we are children of God and it is not yet revealed what we will be But we know that when he is revealed we will be like him for we will see him just as he is,1.0
30584,Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness Sin is lawlessness,1.0
30586,Whoever remains in him doesnt sin Whoever sins hasnt seen him neither knows him,1.0
30587,Little children let no one lead you astray He who does righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous,1.0
30588,He who sins is of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning To this end the Son of God was revealed that he might destroy the works of the devil,1.0
30591,For this is the message which you heard from the beginning that we should love one another,1.0
30594,We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers He who doesnt love his brother remains in death,1.0
30595,Whoever hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him,1.0
30598,My little children lets not love in word only neither with the tongue only but in deed and truth,1.0
30599,And by this we know that we are of the truth and persuade our hearts before him,1.0
30600,because if our heart condemns us God is greater than our heart and knows all things,1.0
30603,This is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another even as he commanded,1.0
30604,He who keeps his commandments remains in him and he in him By this we know that he remains in us by the Spirit which he gave us,1.0
30605,Beloved dont believe every spirit but test the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets have gone out into the world,1.0
30606,By this you know the Spirit of God every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,1.0
30608,You are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world,1.0
30609,They are of the world Therefore they speak of the world and the world hears them,1.0
30610,We are of God He who knows God listens to us He who is not of God doesnt listen to us By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error,1.0
30615,Beloved if God loved us in this way we also ought to love one another,1.0
30617,By this we know that we remain in him and he in us because he has given us of his Spirit,1.0
30618,We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world,1.0
30619,Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God God remains in him and he in God,1.0

30686,wild waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever,1.0
30688,to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him,1.0

30753,He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies,1.0
30754,To the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write He who is holy he who is true he who has the key of David he who opens and no one can shut and who shuts and no one opens says these things,1.0
30755,I know your works behold I have set before you an open door which no one can shut that you have a little power and kept my word and didnt deny my name,1.0

30767,Behold I stand at the door and knock If anyone hears my voice and opens the door then I will come in to him and will dine with him and he with me,1.0
30768,He who overcomes I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne as I also overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne,1.0
30770,After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven and the first voice that I heard like a trumpet speaking with me was one saying Come up here and I will show you the things which must happen after this,1.0
30771,Immediately I was in the Spirit Behold there was a throne set in heaven and one sitting on the throne,1.0
30776,The first creature was like a lion and the second creature like a calf and the third creature had a face like a man and the fourth was like a flying eagle,1.0
30777,The four living creatures each one of them having six wings are full of eyes around about and within They have no rest day and night saying Holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy{TR and NU read holy 3 times instead of 9} is the Lord God the Almighty who was and who is and who is to come!,1.0
30778,When the living creatures give glory honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne to him who lives forever and ever,1.0
30779,the twentyfour elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever and throw their crowns before the throne saying,1.0
30780,Worthy are you our Lord and God the Holy One{TR omits and God the Holy One} to receive the glory the honor and the power for you created all things and because of your desire they existed and were created!,1.0
30781,I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a book written inside and outside sealed shut with seven seals,1.0
30782,I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals,1.0
30783,No one in heaven above or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look in it,1.0
30784,And I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look in it,1.0
30785,One of the elders said to me Dont weep Behold the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah the Root of David has overcome he who opens the book and its seven seals,1.0
30790,And made them kings and priests to our God And they reign on earth,1.0
30793,I heard every created thing which is in heaven on the earth under the earth on the sea and everything in them saying To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing the honor the glory and the dominion forever and ever! Amen!{TR omits Amen!},1.0
30794,The four living creatures said Amen! The {TR adds twentyfour}elders fell down and worshiped{TR adds the one living forever and ever},1.0
30796,And behold a white horse and he who sat on it had a bow A crown was given to him and he came forth conquering and to conquer,1.0
30797,When he opened the second seal I heard the second living creature saying Come!,1.0
30799,When he opened the third seal I heard the third living creature saying Come and see! And behold a black horse and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand,1.0
30801,When he opened the fourth seal I heard the fourth living creature saying Come and see!,1.0
30804,They cried with a loud voice saying How long Master the holy and true until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth,1.0
30805,A long white robe was given to each of them They were told that they should rest yet for a while until their fellow servants and their brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings} who would also be killed even as they were should complete their course,1.0
30807,The stars of the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind,1.0
30808,The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up Every mountain and island were moved out of their places,1.0
30810,They told the mountains and the rocks Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,1.0
30811,for the great day of his wrath has come and who is able to stand,1.0
30812,After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree,1.0
30814,saying Dont harm the earth neither the sea nor the trees until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!,1.0
30816,Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,1.0

30823,saying Amen! Blessing glory wisdom thanksgiving honor power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen,1.0
30824,One of the elders answered saying to me These who are arrayed in white robes who are they and from where did they come,1.0
30826,Therefore they are before the throne of God they serve him day and night in his temple He who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them,1.0
30828,for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them and leads them to springs of waters of life And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes,1.0
30829,When he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour,1.0
30830,I saw the seven angels who stand before God and seven trumpets were given to them,1.0
30831,Another angel came and stood over the altar having a golden censer Much incense was given to him that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne,1.0
30833,The angel took the censer and he filled it with the fire of the altar and threw it on the earth There followed thunders sounds lightnings and an earthquake,1.0
30835,The first sounded and there followed hail and fire mixed with blood and they were thrown to the earth One third of the earth was burnt up{TR omits One third of the earth was burnt up} and one third of the trees were burnt up and all green grass was burnt up,1.0
30836,The second angel sounded and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea One third of the sea became blood,1.0
30837,and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died One third of the ships were destroyed,1.0
30839,The name of the star is called Wormwood One third of the waters became wormwood Many people died from the waters because they were made bitter,1.0
30841,I saw and I heard an eagle{TR reads angel instead of eagle} flying in mid heaven saying with a loud voice Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels who are yet to sound!,1.0
30842,The fifth angel sounded and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him,1.0
30843,He opened the pit of the abyss and smoke went up out of the pit like the smoke from a{TR adds great} burning furnace The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit,1.0
30845,They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those people who dont have Gods seal on their foreheads,1.0
30847,In those days people will seek death and will in no way find it They will desire to die and death will flee from them,1.0
30848,The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war On their heads were something like golden crowns and their faces were like peoples faces,1.0
30849,They had hair like womens hair and their teeth were like those of lions,1.0
30850,They had breastplates like breastplates of iron The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots or of many horses rushing to war,1.0
30854,The sixth angel sounded I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,1.0
30855,saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!,1.0
30856,The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year so that they might kill one third of mankind,1.0
30857,The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million{literally ten thousands of ten thousands} I heard the number of them,1.0
30858,Thus I saw the horses in the vision and those who sat on them having breastplates of fiery red hyacinth blue and sulfur yellow and the heads of lions Out of their mouths proceed fire smoke and sulfur,1.0
30859,By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed by the fire the smoke and the sulfur which proceeded out of their mouths,1.0
30863,I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky clothed with a cloud A rainbow was on his head His face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire,1.0
30864,He had in his hand a little open book He set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land,1.0
30865,He cried with a loud voice as a lion roars When he cried the seven thunders uttered their voices,1.0
30866,When the seven thunders sounded I was about to write but I heard a voice from the sky saying Seal up the things which the seven thunders said and dont write them,1.0
30867,The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky,1.0
30868,and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are in it the earth and the things that are in it and the sea and the things that are in it that there will no longer be delay,1.0
30869,but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to sound then the mystery of God is finished as he declared to his servants the prophets,1.0
30872,I took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it up It was as sweet as honey in my mouth When I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter,1.0
30874,A reed like a rod was given to me Someone said Rise and measure Gods temple and the altar and those who worship in it,1.0
30876,I will give power to my two witnesses and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days clothed in sackcloth,1.0
30877,These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the Lord of the earth,1.0
30878,If anyone desires to harm them fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies If anyone desires to harm them he must be killed in this way,1.0
30879,These have the power to shut up the sky that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy They have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague as often as they desire,1.0
30880,When they have finished their testimony the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and overcome them and kill them,1.0
30881,Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also their Lord was crucified,1.0
30882,From among the peoples tribes languages and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb,1.0
30884,After the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet Great fear fell on those who saw them,1.0
30886,In that day there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven,1.0
30887,The second woe is past Behold the third woe comes quickly,1.0
30888,The seventh angel sounded and great voices in heaven followed saying The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ He will reign forever and ever!,1.0
30890,saying We give you thanks Lord God the Almighty the one who is and who was{TR adds and who is coming} because you have taken your great power and reigned,1.0
30891,The nations were angry and your wrath came as did the time for the dead to be judged and to give your bondservants the prophets their reward as well as to the saints and those who fear your name to the small and the great and to destroy those who destroy the earth,1.0
30892,Gods temple that is in heaven was opened and the ark of the Lords covenant was seen in his temple Lightnings sounds thunders an earthquake and great hail followed,1.0
30894,She was with child She cried out in pain laboring to give birth,1.0
30896,His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky and threw them to the earth The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth so that when she gave birth he might devour her child,1.0
30897,She gave birth to a son a male child who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron Her child was caught up to God and to his throne,1.0
30898,The woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by God that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days,1.0
30904,Therefore rejoice heavens and you who dwell in them Woe to the earth and to the sea because the devil has gone down to you having great wrath knowing that he has but a short time,1.0
30905,When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child,1.0
30906,Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman that she might fly into the wilderness to her place so that she might be nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent,1.0
30907,The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream,1.0
30908,The earth helped the woman and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth,1.0
30909,The dragon grew angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed who keep Gods commandments and hold Jesus testimony,1.0
30912,One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally His fatal wound was healed and the whole earth marveled at the beast,1.0
30913,They worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying Who is like the beast Who is able to make war with him,1.0
30914,A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him Authority to make war for fortytwo months was given to him,1.0
30915,He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his dwelling those who dwell in heaven,1.0
30916,It was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them Authority over every tribe people language and nation was given to him,1.0
30920,I saw another beast coming up out of the earth He had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon,1.0
30921,He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast whose fatal wound was healed,1.0
30922,He performs great signs even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people,1.0
30923,He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast saying to those who dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived,1.0
30925,He causes all the small and the great the rich and the poor and the free and the slave to be given marks on their right hands or on their foreheads,1.0
30927,Here is wisdom He who has understanding let him calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man His number is six hundred sixtysix,1.0
30928,I saw and behold the Lamb standing on Mount Zion and with him a number one hundred fortyfour thousand having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads,1.0
30931,These are those who were not defiled with women for they are virgins These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes These were redeemed by Jesus from among men the first fruits to God and to the Lamb,1.0
30932,In their mouth was found no lie for they are blameless{TR adds before the throne of God},1.0
30934,He said with a loud voice Fear the Lord and give him glory for the hour of his judgment has come Worship him who made the heaven the earth the sea and the springs of waters!,1.0
30935,Another a second angel followed saying Babylon the great has fallen which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality,1.0
30936,Another angel a third followed them saying with a great voice If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,1.0
30937,he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb,1.0
30938,The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever They have no rest day and night those who worship the beast and his image and whoever receives the mark of his name,1.0
30939,Here is the patience of the saints those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus,1.0
30940,I heard the voice from heaven saying Write Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on Yes says the Spirit that they may rest from their labors for their works follow with them,1.0
30941,I looked and behold a white cloud and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle,1.0
